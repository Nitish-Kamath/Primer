Question 1
Problem Statement: "In the context of a relational database, which of the following terms correctly represents the 'degree' of a relation?"

Options:

Domain
No of rows
Cardinality
No of Attributes
Correct Answer: No of Attributes

Explanation:

No of Attributes: The 'degree' of a relation refers to the number of attributes (or columns) in a table. Therefore, this option is correct.
Domain: This is incorrect because a domain refers to the set of permissible values that an attribute can take.
No of rows: This is incorrect because the number of rows refers to the 'cardinality' of a relation, not the degree.
Cardinality: This is incorrect as 'cardinality' represents the number of rows in a relation, not the degree.
Question 2
Problem Statement: "A database is described as a shared collection of logically related data designed to meet the information needs of an organization. Is this statement true or false?"

Options:

FALSE
TRUE
Correct Answer: FALSE

Explanation:

FALSE: This statement is incorrect because a database is actually a shared collection of logically related (not unrelated) data, designed to meet the information needs of an organization.
TRUE: This is incorrect because the statement provided is not accurate.
Question 3
Problem Statement: "Which of the following SQL statements are considered Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands?"

Options:

INSERT
CREATE
TRUNCATE
SELECT
Correct Answers: SELECT, INSERT

Explanation:

SELECT: This is correct because the SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database, which is a primary function of DML.
INSERT: This is correct because INSERT is used to add new records to a database table, which is part of data manipulation.
CREATE: This is incorrect because CREATE is a Data Definition Language (DDL) command used to define database objects like tables and schemas.
TRUNCATE: This is incorrect because TRUNCATE is also a DDL command used to delete all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions.
Question 4
Problem Statement: "Which of the following are considered constraints in SQL?"

Options:

NULL
NOT NULL
Check
Unique
Correct Answers: NOT NULL, Unique, Check

Explanation:

NOT NULL: This is correct because the NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
Unique: This is correct because the Unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are distinct.
Check: This is correct because the Check constraint allows you to specify a condition that must be met for data to be inserted into a column.
NULL: This is incorrect because NULL itself is not a constraint; it's a state indicating the absence of any value.
Question 5
Problem Statement: "Which of the following are recognized as data models in the context of database management?"

Options:

Hierarchical
Conceptual
Relational
Network
Correct Answers: Hierarchical, Network, Relational

Explanation:

Hierarchical: This is correct because the hierarchical model organizes data in a tree-like structure, where each record has a single parent.
Network: This is correct because the network model organizes data using a graph structure, where records can have multiple parent-child relationships.
Relational: This is correct because the relational model organizes data in tables, using rows and columns.
Conceptual: This is incorrect because 'conceptual' is not a type of data model; it's a level of abstraction in database design, typically representing the organizationâ€™s overall structure.
