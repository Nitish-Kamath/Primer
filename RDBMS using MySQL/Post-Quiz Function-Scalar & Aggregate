Question 1
Problem Statement: "Group functions can be used in the WHERE clause. State True or False."

Options:

TRUE
FALSE
Correct Answer: FALSE

Explanation:

Group functions (like SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.) cannot be used directly in the WHERE clause. They can only be used in the HAVING clause to filter groups.
Question 2
Problem Statement: "We need to create a report to display the order id, ship date, and order total from the ORDER table. If the order has not been shipped, the report must display 'Not Shipped'. If the total is not available, it must display 'Not Available'. In the ORDER table, the SHIPDATE column is of type DATE, and the TOTAL column is of type INT. Which statement do you use to create this report?"

Options:

SELECT ordid, IFNULL(shipdate, 'Not Shipped') SHIPDATE, IFNULL(total,'Not Available')TOTAL FROM order; FROM order;
SELECT ordid,TO_CHAR(shipdate, 'Not Shipped'), TO_CHAR(total,'Not Available') FROM order;
SELECT ordid, IFNULL(shipdate, 'Not Shipped') as SHIPDATE, Total FROM order;
SELECT ordid, shipdate "Not Shipped", total "Not Available" FROM order;
Correct Answer: SELECT ordid, IFNULL(shipdate, 'Not Shipped') SHIPDATE, IFNULL(total,'Not Available')TOTAL FROM order;

Explanation:

The IFNULL function is used to handle NULL values by returning a specified value if the original value is NULL.
The correct query will display 'Not Shipped' for orders with no ship date and 'Not Available' for orders with no total.
Question 3
Problem Statement: "All columns in the SELECT list that are not in group functions must be in the GROUP-BY clause. State True or False."

Options:

TRUE
FALSE
Correct Answer: TRUE

Explanation:

When using group functions in a SELECT statement, all non-aggregated columns must be included in the GROUP BY clause. This ensures that the grouping of the data is done correctly.
Question 4
Problem Statement: "Single row functions can be nested to any level. State True or False."

Options:

FALSE
TRUE
Correct Answer: TRUE

Explanation:

Single-row functions, such as UPPER, LOWER, SUBSTR, etc., can be nested to any level. This means you can apply one function within another, like UPPER(SUBSTR(col_name, 1, 3)).
Question 5
Problem Statement: "What will be the output for the below query: select ceil(5.3) from dual;"

Options:

6
None of the options
5.0
5
Correct Answer: 6

Explanation:

The CEIL function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number. For CEIL(5.3), the result is 6.
