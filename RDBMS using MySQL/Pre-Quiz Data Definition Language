Question 1
Problem Statement: "In a relational database, which key is used to enforce referential integrity constraints?"

Options:

Primary Key
Foreign Key
Composite Key
Secondary Key
Correct Answer: Foreign Key

Explanation:

Foreign Key: A foreign key is used to enforce referential integrity by ensuring that a value in one table must match a value in another table. This ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent.
Primary Key: This uniquely identifies each record in a table, but it is not used for enforcing referential integrity between different tables.
Composite Key: This is a key made up of two or more columns to uniquely identify a row in a table. It does not directly enforce referential integrity.
Secondary Key: This is another key that is not the primary key but can be used to index data. It does not enforce referential integrity.
Question 2
Problem Statement: "A relational database consists of a collection of what?"

Options:

Records
Tables
Keys
Fields
Correct Answer: Tables

Explanation:

Tables: In a relational database, data is organized into tables, where each table consists of rows and columns.
Records: While tables are made up of records (rows), a relational database itself is a collection of tables.
Keys: Keys are used to uniquely identify rows within tables, but they do not make up the database.
Fields: Fields refer to the columns in a table, but the relational database is a collection of tables, not fields.
Question 3
Problem Statement: "Which of the following operations is not considered a modification of the database?"

Options:

Updating
Deletion
Insertion
Sorting
Correct Answer: Sorting

Explanation:

Sorting: Sorting does not modify the actual data in the database; it merely changes the order in which data is presented.
Updating: This involves changing existing data, which is a modification.
Deletion: This removes data from the database, which is also a modification.
Insertion: Adding new data to the database is a modification.
Question 4
Problem Statement: "In a database table, what is the column header referred to as?"

Options:

Domain
Relation
Tuples
Attributes
Table
Correct Answer: Attributes

Explanation:

Attributes: The column headers in a table are referred to as attributes, which define the type of data stored in each column.
Domain: This is the range of allowable values for an attribute, not the column header itself.
Relation: In relational databases, a relation is typically a table.
Tuples: This refers to the rows in the table, not the columns.
Table: This is the entire structure, which contains rows and columns, not just the column header.
Question 5
Problem Statement: "Which SQL command removes data from a table while keeping the table structure intact?"

Options:

Trunc
Truncate
None of the options
Drop
Correct Answer: Truncate

Explanation:

Truncate: The TRUNCATE command removes all rows from a table, but the table structure (columns, constraints, etc.) remains intact.
Trunc: This is not a valid SQL command.
None of the options: Since "Truncate" is correct, this is not the right choice.
Drop: The DROP command removes the entire table, including its structure, from the database.
