Question 1
String s1 = null; is a valid declaration of a String.

Explanation: This is a valid declaration. It initializes s1 as a String reference that currently points to null. This is useful for initializing a variable that will be assigned a value later.
Question 2
Determine the output:

java
Copy code
class Evaluate { 
    public static void main(String args[]) { 
        int arr[] = new int[] {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; 
        int n = 6; 
        n = arr[arr[n] / 2]; 
        System.out.println(arr[n] / 2); 
    } 
}
Explanation:
arr[n] is arr[6], which is 6.
arr[6] / 2 is 6 / 2, which is 3.
Thus, n = arr[3], which is 3.
arr[n] / 2 is arr[3] / 2, which is 3 / 2, yielding 1 (integer division).
Correct Answer: 1
Question 3
+ operator can be used to concatenate two or more String objects in Java. State true or false.

Explanation: The + operator is used for concatenating String objects in Java.

Correct Answer: True

Question 4
What is special about string objects compared to objects of other derived types?

Explanation:
a. You can create string objects without or with the new operator.: True. You can use string literals or the new keyword.
b. Java provides a string constant pool to store the string objects.: True. Strings are interned in the string pool for optimization.
c. You can concatenate two string objects using +.: True. The + operator is used for string concatenation.
Correct Answers: a, b, c
Question 5
Determine the output:

java
Copy code
public class Trial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int arr[4]={};
        System.out.print(arr[0]);
    }
}
Explanation: The syntax int arr[4] is incorrect. The correct syntax should be int[] arr = new int[4];.

Correct Answer: Compile time error

Question 6
What is the string contained in s after the following lines of code?

java
Copy code
StringBuffer s = new StringBuffer("Hello");
s.deleteCharAt(0);
Explanation: deleteCharAt(0) removes the first character ('H'), resulting in "ello".

Correct Answer: ello

Question 7
Determine the output:

java
Copy code
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] x = new int[3];
        System.out.println("x[0] is " + x[0]);
    }
}
Explanation: Arrays of primitive types in Java are initialized with default values. For integers, the default value is 0.

Correct Answer: The program runs fine and displays x[0] is 0.

Question 8
Given a one-dimensional array arr, what is the correct way of getting the number of elements in arr?

Explanation: The .length property of an array returns the number of elements.

Correct Answer: arr.length

Question 9
Determine the output:

java
Copy code
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] x = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int[] y = x;
        x = new int[2];
        for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++)
            System.out.print(y[i] + " ");
    }
}
Explanation: y still references the original array [1, 2, 3, 4]. x is now a new array with 2 elements [0, 0], but y still has the original values.

Correct Answer: 1 2

Question 10
What will table contain after executing the following code?

java
Copy code
public class Trial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] table = new int[5][5];
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (j == i) {
                    table[i][j] = 1;
                } else {
                    table[i][j] = 0;
                }
                System.out.print(table[i][j]);
            }
            System.out.println("\n");
        }
    }
}
Explanation: The code creates a 5x5 array but only prints the first 3 rows and columns, setting 1 on the diagonal (j == i) and 0 elsewhere.

Correct Answer: 1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n

Question 11
Predict the output:

java
Copy code
class String_demo {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int ascii[] = { 65, 66, 67, 68};
        String s = new String(ascii, 1, 3);
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
Explanation: The String constructor takes the ascii array starting at index 1, with a length of 3. So it converts the values 66, 67, 68 to characters 'B', 'C', 'D'.

Correct Answer: BCD

Question 12
How must this code be changed to be thread-safe?

java
Copy code
public class MyLogger {
    private StringBuilder logger = new StringBuilder();
    public void log(String message, String user) {
        logger.append(message);
        logger.append(user);
    }
}
Explanation: StringBuilder is not thread-safe. Replacing it with StringBuffer would make it thread-safe.

Correct Answer: Replace StringBuilder with StringBuffer

Question 13
What is used to find the string length?

Explanation: The length() method returns the length of a string.

Correct Answer: length()

Question 14
What is used to allocate memory to an array variable in Java?

Explanation: The new keyword is used to allocate memory for arrays.

Correct Answer: new

Question 15
Determine the output:

java
Copy code
public class A {
    public static void main(String argv[]) {
        int ary[] = new int[]{1,2,3};
        System.out.println(ary[1]);
    }
}
Explanation: The array ary is initialized with {1, 2, 3}. ary[1] refers to the value 2.

Correct Answer: 2

Question 16
Fill in appropriately:

java
Copy code
String st1 = new String("JAVA");
String st2 = new String("JAVA");
String st3 = "JAVA";
Explanation:
st1 and st2 are two objects in heap memory created using new String().
st3 is a reference to a single object in the string pool.
Correct Answer: 3 objects, 2 in heap memory, and 1 in string pool
Question 17
Determine the output:

java
Copy code
class Output {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int a1[] = new int[10];
        int a2[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        System.out.println(a1.length + " " + a2.length);
    }
}
Explanation: a1 is initialized with 10 elements, so its length is 10. a2 is initialized with 5 elements, so its length is 5.

Correct Answer: 10 5

Question 18
Determine the output:

java
Copy code
class array_output {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        char array_variable[] = new char[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
            array_variable[i] = 'i';
            System.out.print(array_variable[i] + "");
        }
    }
}
Explanation: The array_variable array is filled with the character 'i' and printed.

Correct Answer: i i i i i i i i i i

Question 19
Predict the output:

java
Copy code
class String_demo {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        char chars[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
        String s = new String(chars);
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
Explanation: The character array chars is converted to a string, resulting in "abc".

Correct Answer: abc

Question 20
Column size is mandatory to create an array in Java. State true or false.

Explanation: In Java, you can create arrays without specifying the size at the time of declaration (for example, using new int[10]), but column size (for multi-dimensional arrays) is not mandatory.

Correct Answer: False

Question 21
What will s2 contain after the following lines of code?

java
Copy code
String s1 = "one";
String s2 = s1.concat("two");
Explanation: The concat method appends "two" to "one", resulting in "onetwo".

Correct Answer: onetwo
