Question 1
Output of the program:

java
Copy code
class Output  {
    public static void main(String args[])  {
        int a1[] = new int[10];
        int a2[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        System.out.println(a1.length + " " + a2.length);
    }
}
Correct Answer: 10 5

Explanation: a1 is an array of 10 elements, so a1.length is 10. a2 is an array with 5 elements, so a2.length is 5.
Question 2
In which of the following packages can you find the String class?

Correct Answer: lang

Explanation: The String class is located in the java.lang package.
Question 3
Given:

java
Copy code
String name = "teknoturf";
String cname = "teknoturf";
String compname = new String("teknoturf");

1. if(name == cname)
2. if(name.equals(cname))
3. if(name == compname)
4. if(name.equals(compname))
Correct Answer: Line 1, 2, 4 will return true.

Explanation:
name == cname: true because both refer to the same string literal.
name.equals(cname): true because they have the same value.
name == compname: false because compname is a new object.
name.equals(compname): true because they have the same value.
Question 4
Result of compiling and executing:

java
Copy code
class ArrayTest {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int[] primes = new int[10];
        primes[0] = "a";
        System.out.println(primes[0]);
    }
}
Correct Answer: compile time error

Explanation: You cannot assign a String to an int array. This results in a compilation error.
Question 5
Correct ways of declaring an Array:

Correct Answers:

int []studentId;
int studentId[];
String [] name [];
Explanation:

int []studentId; and int studentId[]; are valid array declarations.
String [] name []; is valid but unconventional.
String name[]=new String(10); and int studentId[10]; are incorrect.
Question 6
Advanced for loop is better as it is less error prone as we don't need to deal with index.

Correct Answer: True

Explanation: The enhanced for loop (for-each) simplifies iteration and reduces errors related to index management.
Question 7
Result of compiling and executing:

java
Copy code
class TestArray {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int arr_sample[] = new int[2];
        System.out.println(arr_sample[0]);
    }
}
Correct Answer: The program compiles and prints 0 when executed.

Explanation: Arrays of primitive types are initialized to default values. For int, the default value is 0.
Question 8
String Objects are mutable.

Correct Answer: False

Explanation: String objects in Java are immutable. Once created, their values cannot be changed.
Question 9
StringBuilder is less efficient and slower than StringBuffer.

Correct Answer: False

Explanation: StringBuilder is generally faster than StringBuffer because it is not synchronized. StringBuffer is thread-safe but slower due to synchronization overhead.
Question 10
Given a one-dimensional array arr, what is the correct way of getting the number of elements in arr?

Correct Answer: arr.length

Explanation: The length property of an array returns the number of elements.
Question 11
StringBuffer is used to create ______________.

Correct Answer: a mutable String

Explanation: StringBuffer creates mutable strings, allowing modifications after creation.
