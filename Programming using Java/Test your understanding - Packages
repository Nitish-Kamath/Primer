Question 1
Given the below code:

java
Copy code
import static java.lang.Math.PI;

public class AreaCalculator {
    public double calculateArea(double radius) {   
        double area = PI * radius * radius;  // Instead of Math.PI
        return area;
    } 
}
Select the correct statement to use the static variable PI.

Correct Answer:

import static java.lang.Math.PI;
Explanation: The import static statement allows direct access to the static variable PI without needing to prefix it with Math..

Question 2
Given the class Book and Library in two different packages:

java
Copy code
// In package model
package model;

public class Book {
    private static void countBook() { }
}

// In package util
package util;

public class Library {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // insert code here
    }
}
What is required at line 4 in class Library to use the countBook method of Book class?

Correct Answer:

Library class cannot use the countBook method in Book class.
Explanation: The countBook method in the Book class is private, so it cannot be accessed from any other class, including the Library class in a different package.

Question 3
Choose the correct order of the code:

java
Copy code
public class Main ---------------- 1
import java.util.Scanner;-------- 2
{------------------------------------- 3
// Some code here----------------- 4
}------------------------------------ 5
package test;--------------------- 6
Select one:

a. 2 6 1 3 4 5
b. 6 1 2 3 4 5
c. 6 2 1 3 4 5
d. 6 1 3 2 4 5

Correct Answer:

6 2 1 3 4 5
Explanation: The package statement must be the first statement in the file (line 6), followed by imports (line 2). Then, the class definition (line 1) and its content (lines 3-5) follow.

Question 4
Given the class Book in package p1 and class Main in package p2. In main, to create an object of Book, which of the following are valid?

Options:

Book bookObj = new Book();
p1.Book bookObj = new Book();
p1.Book bookObj = new p1.Book();
Correct Answer:

p1.Book bookObj = new p1.Book();
Explanation: Since Book is in the p1 package, you need to specify the full package name p1.Book when creating an object from p2. The p1.Book bookObj = new Book(); syntax is incorrect because Book must be fully qualified.

Question 5
Assume class Calculator in package p1 and CalculatorService class in package p2 as shown below:

java
Copy code
// In package p1
package p1;

public class Calculator {
    __________ static void calculate() {
        // some code here
    }
}

// In package p2
package p2;

import p1.Calculator;

public class CalculatorService {
    public void display() {
        Calculator.calculate();
    }
}
What can be the valid access specifier for the calculate method in Calculator class so that it can be accessed from CalculatorService class?

Correct Answer:

public
Explanation: To allow access to the calculate method from a different package, it must be declared public. The other access specifiers (default, protected, private) do not permit access from classes outside the package.
