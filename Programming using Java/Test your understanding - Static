Question 1
Which of the following code can be included in Line 1?

java
Copy code
public class Employee { 
    String name;
    static int employeeCount;

    //Line 1
}
Options:

java
Copy code
public void display(){
    System.out.println("Employee count "+employeeCount);
}
java
Copy code
public static void display(){
    System.out.println("Employee count "+employeeCount);
}
java
Copy code
public static void display() {
    System.out.println("Employee Name"+name);
}
java
Copy code
public void display(){
    System.out.println("Employee Name"+name);
}
Correct Answers:

public static void display(){ System.out.println("Employee count "+employeeCount); }
public void display(){ System.out.println("Employee count "+employeeCount); }
public void display(){ System.out.println("Employee Name"+name); }
Explanation:

A static method can only access static members (e.g., employeeCount) directly.
A non-static method can access both static members and non-static members (e.g., name and employeeCount).
Question 2
Choose the correct option:

java
Copy code
public class Flight{ 
    int flightId;
    static int noOfSeats;

    public static void display(){
        System.out.println("No of seats "+noOfSeats);
    }
}
Correct Answer:

public static void display(){ System.out.println("No of seats "+noOfSeats); }
Explanation: Static methods can only access static members directly. Here, noOfSeats is static and can be accessed directly within the static method display(). flightId is non-static and cannot be accessed directly in a static method.

Question 3
For the below code, what are the valid ways to invoke the display method in the main method?

java
Copy code
public class Test {
    public static void display(){
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String a[]){
        //Invoke the display method
    }
}
Options:

Test.display();
display();
new Test().display();
Correct Answers:

Test.display();
new Test().display();
Explanation:

Static methods can be invoked using the class name (Test.display()) or via an instance of the class (new Test().display()). The direct method call display(); without a class or instance is not valid for static methods.
Question 4
Observe the below code and choose the options so that the output will be

Output:
Count is 1
Count is 3
java
Copy code
public class Product {
    int productId;
    String productName;
    static int count = 0;

    public Product(int pid, String name) {
        productId = pid;
        productName = name;
        count++;
    }

    public static void main(String arg[]) {
        Product p1 = new Product(101, "Screws");
        System.out.println("Count is " + Product.count);

        Product p2 = new Product(102, "Nuts");
        Product p3 = new Product(103, "Nails");
        System.out.println("Count is " + Product.count);
    }
}
Correct Options:

System.out.println("Count is "+Product.count); (placed after creating p1)
System.out.println("Count is "+Product.count); (placed after creating p3)
Explanation:

The first print statement shows the count after creating one Product object (p1), which is 1.
The second print statement shows the count after creating three Product objects (p1, p2, p3), which is 3.
Question 5
Match the following:

Non-static method

Answer 1: Can access both static and non-static members
Static method

Answer 2: Can access static members only
Explanation:

Non-static methods can access both static and non-static members because they are associated with an instance of the class.
Static methods can only access static members directly because they belong to the class rather than any specific instance.
