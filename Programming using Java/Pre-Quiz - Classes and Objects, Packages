Question 1
State True or False: When using Eclipse, whichever classes are needed for the present class can be imported automatically.

Correct Answer: True

Explanation: Eclipse can automatically import required classes using the "Organize Imports" feature or by using shortcut keys (like Ctrl + Shift + O). This helps in managing imports efficiently without manually adding them.

Question 2
What will be the output of the following code?

java
Copy code
int i = 20;

if (i > 10) {
    System.out.println("The value of i is " + i);
    i++;
    if (i % 2 != 0)
        break;
}
Correct Answer: Compilation fails

Explanation: The break statement is used to exit loops or switch statements. Here, break is used outside of a loop or switch context, which causes a compilation error.

Question 3
Predict the output.

java
Copy code
public class Test {
    public static void main(String args[]) {       
        int a = 2, b = 0;
        for (; b < 20; ++b) {
            if (b % a == 0)
                continue; 
            else if (b == 10)
                break;
            else
                System.out.print(b + " ");
        }
    }
}
Correct Answer: 1 3 5 7 9

Explanation: The loop prints numbers that are not divisible by 2 and stops when b reaches 10. The continue statement skips printing numbers that are divisible by 2, so you get only odd numbers less than 10.

Question 4
In Eclipse IDE, if we provide a workspace, it should already exist. If not, it will not open.

Correct Answer: False

Explanation: In Eclipse, you can specify a workspace location, and if it doesn’t exist, Eclipse will create it for you. It does not require the workspace to already exist.

Question 5
switch(a)

java
Copy code
{
    default:
        System.out.println("Welcome");
}
Of which data types can the variable ‘a’ be?

Correct Answer: 2, 3, 4, and 6

Explanation: The switch statement in Java can work with byte, short, int, char, and their corresponding wrapper classes. long and float are not supported directly in switch statements.

1 (long): Not allowed.
2 (byte): Allowed.
3 (int): Allowed.
4 (char): Allowed.
5 (float): Not allowed.
6 (short): Allowed.
