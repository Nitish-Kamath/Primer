Question 3
In the context of AI, which model type is more concerned with the underlying distribution of data?

Hybrid AI: Refers to combining different AI techniques, not specifically related to data distribution.
Classification AI: Focuses on categorizing data into predefined classes, not modeling data distribution.
Generative AI: Correct; Generative AI models the overall data distribution to create new data samples.
Regression AI: Involves predicting continuous values but does not primarily focus on data distribution.
Reinforcement AI: Focuses on learning optimal actions through rewards, not on data distribution.
Correct Answer: Generative AI

Correct Answer: Predicting stock market prices

Question 5
How does Generative AI differ from Classification AI?

It requires more data: Not necessarily true; Generative AI and Classification AI both require substantial data, but for different purposes.
It's easier to implement: Incorrect; Generative AI can be complex and challenging to implement.
It generates new data rather than categorizing existing data: Correct; Generative AI creates new data samples, whereas Classification AI categorizes existing data.
It's faster: Incorrect; speed depends on implementation and computational resources, not inherently faster or slower.
It's more accurate: Incorrect; accuracy is context-dependent and varies with implementation and data.
Correct Answer: It generates new data rather than categorizing existing data

Question 6
Generative AI can be used to create which of the following?

New artworks and music pieces: Correct; Generative AI is used to create original artworks and music based on learned patterns.
Classification categories: Incorrect; Generative AI does not create categories, which are handled by classification models.
Decision boundaries: Incorrect; Generative AI is not focused on decision boundaries but on generating data.
Data labels: Incorrect; Generative AI does not typically create data labels; this is done by supervised learning.
Regression models: Incorrect; Generative AI is not used for creating regression models.
Correct Answer: New artworks and music pieces

Question 7
If an AI system is designed to label images of cats and dogs, it is primarily a _______ model.

Unsupervised: Incorrect; unsupervised models learn patterns from unlabeled data and do not focus on labeling.
Discriminative: Correct; Discriminative models focus on categorizing or labeling data into classes.
Hybrid: Incorrect; hybrid refers to a combination of different AI methods, not specifically for labeling.
Reinforcement: Incorrect; reinforcement learning focuses on decision-making based on rewards, not labeling.
Generative: Incorrect; Generative models create new data, not label existing data.
Correct Answer: Discriminative

Question 8
Which AI type is best for predicting outcomes?

Regression AI: Correct; Regression AI is specifically designed to predict continuous outcomes based on input data.
Generative AI: Focuses on creating new data rather than predicting outcomes.
Semi-supervised AI: Combines labeled and unlabeled data, but prediction is not its primary focus.
Reinforcement AI: Focuses on learning optimal actions rather than predicting outcomes.
Classification AI: Used for categorizing data, not for predicting continuous outcomes.
Correct Answer: Regression AI

Question 9
Which statement best describes the role of Generative AI?

It is exclusively used in robotics: Incorrect; Generative AI is not limited to robotics.
It focuses on generating data based on learned patterns: Correct; Generative AI creates new data samples based on patterns learned from existing data.
It is the oldest form of AI: Incorrect; Generative AI is not the oldest form and is relatively recent.
It is primarily used for data sorting: Incorrect; Generative AI is used for generating new data, not sorting.
It is best suited for regression tasks: Incorrect; Generative AI is not focused on regression but on creating new data.
Correct Answer: It focuses on generating data based on learned patterns

Question 10
Which of the following is a direct application of Generative AI in the entertainment industry?
