Question 1
Which of the following is NOT a type of AI?

Supervised AI: A type of AI where the model is trained on labeled data, learning to predict outcomes based on input-output pairs.
Reinforcement AI: Refers to reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken in an environment.
Generative AI: AI that generates new data samples from learned patterns, such as creating realistic images, text, or music.
Generative Art: While related to Generative AI, it specifically refers to art created by algorithms or AI systems. Itâ€™s not a type of AI itself but a result of using Generative AI techniques.
Unsupervised AI: A type of AI where the model is trained on unlabeled data and learns to identify patterns and structures without predefined labels.
Correct Answer: Generative Art

Question 2
Which of the following is a real-world example of Generative AI?

Sorting emails: Typically handled by classification algorithms rather than Generative AI.
Generating realistic human faces in movies: A common application of Generative AI, where models create highly realistic images or videos.
Predicting stock market prices: Often involves predictive analytics and regression models, not typically classified as Generative AI.
Translating languages: Involves machine translation models, which can use Generative techniques but are not solely Generative AI.
Automating cars: Involves a variety of AI techniques, including reinforcement learning and computer vision, but not exclusively Generative AI.
Correct Answer: Generating realistic human faces in movies

Question 3
Which statement best defines Generative AI?

AI that classifies data: Refers to classification tasks, typically handled by discriminative models.

Advanced Integration: Incorrect; not related to AI.
Automated Interaction: Incorrect; does not represent AI.
Artificial Intelligence: Correct; the full form of AI.
Correct Answer: Artificial Intelligence

Question 5
Which type of AI is primarily concerned with how data is generated rather than how it's separated?

Reinforcement Learning: Focuses on training agents through rewards and penalties, not directly related to data generation.
Unsupervised Learning: Focuses on finding patterns in data without labels, not specifically on data generation.
Supervised Learning: Involves training models on labeled data to predict outcomes, not focused on data generation.
Generative AI: Specifically concerned with creating new data samples based on learned patterns.
Discriminative AI: Focuses on classifying or separating data into categories, not on data generation.
Correct Answer: Generative AI

Question 6
In which application is Generative AI NOT typically used?

Designing virtual environments: Generative AI can be used to create complex and realistic virtual environments.
Generating music: Generative AI is often used to compose new and original music.
Creating art: Generative AI is used to create original artworks.
Producing realistic video game characters: Generative AI is used to design lifelike characters in games.
Automating customer service chats: Typically handled by chatbots and conversational AI, which may use generative techniques but are not exclusively Generative AI.
Correct Answer: Automating customer service chats

Question 7
Which of the following fields can utilize Generative AI to create new, original content or simulations?

Transportation: Generally involves AI for routing and logistics, not specifically Generative AI.
Art and Music: Generative AI is heavily used to create new and original art and music.
Data Analysis: Involves analyzing data patterns rather than generating new content.
Banking: Uses AI for fraud detection and risk management, not primarily for content generation.
E-commerce: Uses AI for recommendations and personalization, not typically Generative AI.
Correct Answer: Art and Music

Question 8
Generative AI is closely related to which type of models?

Regression models: Used for predicting continuous values, not related to Generative AI.
Clustering models: Used for grouping similar data points, not related to Generative AI.
Decision trees: Used for classification and regression tasks, not related to Generative AI.
Generative models: Specifically designed to generate new data samples based on learned patterns.
Classification models: Used for categorizing data, not related to Generative AI.
Correct Answer: Generative models

Question 9
What distinguishes Generative AI from Discriminative AI?

Generative focuses on labeling, Discriminative on generating: Incorrect; Generative AI focuses on creating new data, not labeling.
Both are the same: Incorrect; they serve different purposes.
Generative is for images, Discriminative for text: Incorrect; Generative AI is not limited to images and Discriminative AI is not limited to text.
Generative models data distribution, while Discriminative models the boundary between classes: Correct; Generative AI models the overall data distribution, while Discriminative AI focuses on classifying data.
Generative is older, Discriminative is newer: Incorrect; age is not the distinguishing factor.
Correct Answer: Generative models data distribution, while Discriminative models the boundary between classes

Question 10
Which AI type primarily focuses on labeling data?

Reinforcement AI: Focuses on decision-making and learning from rewards, not on labeling data.
Regression AI: Used for predicting continuous outcomes, not on labeling data.
Supervised AI: Involves learning from labeled data to make predictions or classifications.
Generative AI: Focuses on generating new data samples, not labeling.
Semi-supervised AI: Uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data but does not primarily focus on labeling.
Correct Answer: Supervised AI
