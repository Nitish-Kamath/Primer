Question 1
What does likelihood measure in the context of a model?

The probability of the model being correct: Not correct; likelihood measures how well the model explains the observed data, not the probability of the model's correctness.
How well the model explains the observed data: Correct; likelihood quantifies how probable the observed data is given the model parameters.
The complexity of the model: Not correct; model complexity is typically assessed using metrics like model size or regularization techniques.
The generative capacity of the model: Not correct; generative capacity refers to the model's ability to generate new data samples, not likelihood.
The error rate of the model: Not correct; error rate measures performance but not the likelihood.
Correct Answer: How well the model explains the observed data

Question 2
What is the primary goal of generative models in AI?

To classify data: Not correct; classification is the goal of discriminative models, not generative models.
To generate new data samples: Correct; generative models aim to create new data samples that are similar to the training data.
To optimize algorithms: Not correct; optimization is a broader concept not specific to generative models.
To reduce computational cost: Not correct; reducing computational cost is not the primary goal of generative models.
To analyze data distributions: Not correct; while generative models do analyze data distributions, their main goal is to generate new data.
Correct Answer: To generate new data samples

Question 3
In the context of generative models, what does P(x) represent?

The posterior probability of x: Not correct; the posterior probability refers to the probability of parameters given data, not just P(x).
The likelihood of x: Not correct; likelihood is related to the probability of data given parameters.
The joint probability of x and y: Not correct; joint probability includes both x and y, not just x.
The conditional probability of x given y: Not correct; this represents a different conditional relationship.
The probability distribution of the data x: Correct; P(x) represents the probability distribution of the data x in generative models.
Correct Answer: The probability distribution of the data x

Question 4
Generative models are primarily used for which of the following tasks?

Reinforcement learning: Not correct; reinforcement learning is a different type of machine learning.
Clustering: Not correct; clustering is an unsupervised learning task, not specific to generative models.
Generating new data samples similar to the input data: Correct; generative models create new samples that resemble the input data.
Regression: Not correct; regression is a predictive modeling task, not specific to generative models.
Classification: Not correct; classification is a task for discriminative models, not generative models.
Correct Answer: Generating new data samples similar to the input data

Question 5
If a model is better at distinguishing between classes rather than generating data, it is likely a _______.

Discriminative model: Correct; discriminative models focus on distinguishing between classes rather than generating data.
Joint probability model: Not correct; joint probability models describe the probability of multiple variables together.
Bayesian model: Not correct; Bayesian models can be used for both generative and discriminative tasks.
Likelihood model: Not correct; likelihood is a concept used in both generative and discriminative contexts.
Generative model: Not correct; generative models are focused on generating data, not distinguishing between classes.
Correct Answer: Discriminative model

Question 6
Which of the following is crucial for understanding the behavior of generative models?

Gradient descent: Not correct; gradient descent is an optimization technique used in training models, not specific to generative models.
Activation functions: Not correct; activation functions are important in all neural networks but not specific to generative models.
Probability distributions and likelihood: Correct; understanding probability distributions and likelihood is crucial for analyzing generative models.
Backpropagation: Not correct; backpropagation is used for training models but not specifically for understanding generative models.
Convolutional layers: Not correct; convolutional layers are used in CNNs, not specifically related to understanding generative models.
Correct Answer: Probability distributions and likelihood

Question 7
Which model type is primarily concerned with determining P(y | x)?

Discriminative Model: Correct; discriminative models focus on modeling the conditional probability P(y | x), where y is the output and x is the input.
Probability Distribution: Not correct; this is a general term, not a specific model type.
Bayesian model: Not correct; Bayesian models can model both P(x | y) and P(y | x).
Both Generative and Discriminative: Not correct; while generative models can be used to compute P(x | y), discriminative models specifically focus on P(y | x).
Generative Model: Not correct; generative models focus on P(x) and P(x | y), not P(y | x).
Correct Answer: Discriminative Model

Question 8
In the context of models, what does P(x | y) typically represent?

The distribution of y: Not correct; P(x | y) represents the distribution of x given y, not y alone.
The likelihood of y: Not correct; P(x | y) is about x given y, not just y.
The probability of y given x: Not correct; this is P(y | x).
The generative capacity of x: Not correct; generative capacity refers to the ability to generate data, not the probability of x given y.
The probability of x given y: Correct; P(x | y) represents the conditional probability of x given y.
Correct Answer: The probability of x given y

Question 9
Which of the following is NOT a generative model?

Generative Adversarial Networks: Not correct; GANs are a type of generative model.
Gaussian Mixture Models: Not correct; GMMs are generative models used for density estimation.
Variational Autoencoders: Not correct; VAEs are generative models used to create new data samples.
Restricted Boltzmann Machines: Not correct; RBMs are generative models used for unsupervised learning.
Support Vector Machines: Correct; SVMs are discriminative models used for classification and regression, not generative models.
Correct Answer: Support Vector Machines

Question 10
Which statement best differentiates generative from discriminative models?

Generative models learn the joint probability distribution, while discriminative models learn the conditional probability: Correct; generative models model the joint probability P(x, y) and can generate new samples, while discriminative models focus on the conditional probability P(y | x) and are used for classification tasks.
Both models serve the same purpose: Not correct; they serve different purposesâ€”generative models create data, while discriminative models classify data.
Generative models cannot be trained with labeled data: Not correct; generative models can use labeled data but are primarily focused on generating data.
Generative models are only for images, discriminative for text: Not correct; both model types can be used for various types of data, including images and text.
Generative models are newer than discriminative models: Not correct; generative and discriminative models have been developed and used in parallel for different purposes.
Correct Answer: Generative models learn the joint probability distribution, while discriminative models learn the conditional probability
