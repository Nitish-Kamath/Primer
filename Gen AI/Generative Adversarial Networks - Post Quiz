Question 1
The generator's objective in GANs is to...

None of the given options: Not correct; there is a specific objective for the generator.
Reduce mode collapse: Not correct; reducing mode collapse is not the primary objective of the generator.
Fool the discriminator: Correct; the generator's objective is to create data that is indistinguishable from real data by the discriminator.
Classify real vs. fake: Not correct; classification is the discriminator's role.
Improve model accuracy: Not correct; accuracy improvement is not the direct goal of the generator.
Correct Answer: Fool the discriminator

Question 2
Which GAN variant can be conditioned on labels to generate specific outputs?

None of the given options: Not correct; there is a specific variant that fits the description.
Progressive GAN: Not correct; progressive GANs focus on image resolution.
Mode Collapse GAN: Not correct; mode collapse is a problem, not a GAN variant.
Conditional GAN: Correct; Conditional GANs can be conditioned on labels to generate specific outputs.
Minimax GAN: Not correct; minimax refers to the game theory concept, not a GAN variant.
Correct Answer: Conditional GAN

Question 3
In GANs, if the discriminator becomes too powerful, what can happen?

The generator may struggle to improve: Correct; if the discriminator becomes too powerful, the generator may struggle to improve because it cannot fool the discriminator.
The training process speeds up: Not correct; an overly powerful discriminator can actually hinder the generator's progress.
The model achieves perfect accuracy: Not correct; perfect accuracy is not achievable, and this is not the consequence of a powerful discriminator.
The generator becomes powerful too: Not correct; the generator may struggle instead.
None of the given options: Not correct; there is a specific outcome.
Correct Answer: The generator may struggle to improve

Question 4
Mode collapse is problematic because...

It makes the discriminator weak: Not correct; mode collapse is a problem with the generator, not the discriminator.
It requires more data: Not correct; mode collapse does not necessarily require more data.
None of the given options: Not correct; there is a specific problem with mode collapse.
It speeds up training: Not correct; mode collapse affects the diversity of outputs, not training speed.
It limits the diversity of generated outputs: Correct; mode collapse limits the diversity of generated outputs, as the generator produces similar samples.
Correct Answer: It limits the diversity of generated outputs

Question 5
In the minimax game of GANs, what is the discriminator's goal?

Maximize the generator's loss: Not correct; although this is an indirect outcome, the discriminator's direct goal is different.
None of the given options: Not correct; there is a specific goal for the discriminator.
Generate realistic data: Not correct; generating data is the generator's role.
Minimize its own loss: Not correct; minimizing loss is part of training but not the direct goal.
Distinguish between real and fake data: Correct; the discriminator's goal is to distinguish between real and fake data.
Correct Answer: Distinguish between real and fake data

Question 6
Which statement about GANs is true?

They always converge to a solution: Not correct; GANs do not always converge.
They only work with images: Not correct; GANs can work with various data types.
None of the given options: Not correct; there is a true statement about GANs.
They can generate new, previously unseen data: Correct; GANs can generate new, previously unseen data.
They are a type of supervised learning: Not correct; GANs are an unsupervised learning method.
Correct Answer: They can generate new, previously unseen data

Question 7
Which GAN variant focuses on gradually increasing the resolution of generated images?

Mode Collapse GAN: Not correct; mode collapse is a problem, not a GAN variant.
Minimax GAN: Not correct; minimax refers to the game theory concept, not a GAN variant.
Progressive GAN: Correct; Progressive GANs focus on gradually increasing the resolution of generated images.
Conditional GAN: Not correct; conditional GANs focus on label-conditioned generation.
None of the given options: Not correct; there is a specific variant that fits the description.
Correct Answer: Progressive GAN

Question 8
Which is NOT a real-world application of GANs?

Style transfer: Not correct; GANs can be used for style transfer.
Art generation: Not correct; GANs are often used for art generation.
Data augmentation: Not correct; GANs can be used for data augmentation.
Super-resolution imaging: Not correct; GANs can enhance image resolution.
Real-time weather prediction: Correct; GANs are not typically used for real-time weather prediction.
Correct Answer: Real-time weather prediction

Question 9
Which component of a GAN tries to produce fake data?

Encoder: Not correct; encoders are not part of the standard GAN architecture.
Decoder: Not correct; decoders are not part of the standard GAN architecture.
None of the given options: Not correct; there is a specific component that produces fake data.
Discriminator: Not correct; the discriminator evaluates data, not produces it.
Generator: Correct; the generator tries to produce fake data.
Correct Answer: Generator

Question 10
What is a challenge in evaluating the performance of GANs?

They are too fast: Not correct; speed is not the challenge here.
They require large datasets: Not correct; while large datasets can be helpful, the challenge is different.
They always outperform other models: Not correct; GANs do not always outperform other models.
Determining the quality of generated data: Correct; evaluating the quality of generated data is a challenge in GANs.
None of the given options: Not correct; there is a specific challenge in evaluating GANs.
Correct Answer: Determining the quality of generated data
