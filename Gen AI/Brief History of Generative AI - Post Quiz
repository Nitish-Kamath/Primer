Question 1
In the context of GANs, what is the role of the Discriminator?

To distinguish between real and generated data: Correct; the Discriminator's role is to evaluate whether a given data sample is from the real dataset or generated by the Generator.
To transform data: Not correct; transforming data is not the role of the Discriminator.
To decode data: Not correct; decoding is typically the role of encoders/decoders in models like VAEs.
To encode data: Not correct; encoding data is usually the role of VAEs or similar models.
