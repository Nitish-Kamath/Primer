Correct Answer: Generator

Question 4
In the GAN architecture, what is the primary goal of the Discriminator?

Question 7
In GANs, which component is responsible for evaluating the authenticity of data?

Encoder: Not correct; encoders are not part of the standard GAN architecture.
Decoder: Not correct; decoders are not part of the standard GAN architecture.
Discriminator: Correct; the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of data.
None of the given options: Not correct; the discriminator is the correct answer.
Generator: Not correct; the generator creates data, but does not evaluate it.
Correct Answer: Discriminator

Question 8
Which of the following is a real-world application where GANs have shown significant promise?

Image-to-image translation: Correct; GANs have shown significant promise in image-to-image translation tasks.
Speech recognition: Not correct; GANs are not typically used for speech recognition.
Text summarization: Not correct; GANs are not commonly used for text summarization.
Time series forecasting: Not correct; GANs are not typically used for time series forecasting.
Image classification: Not correct; GANs are not typically used for image classification.
Correct Answer: Image-to-image translation

Question 9
Which type of GAN allows for generating data based on specific categories?

Progressive GAN: Not correct; progressive GANs do not specifically focus on categories.
Mode Collapse GAN: Not correct; mode collapse is a problem, not a specific type of GAN.
None of the given options: Not correct; there is a type of GAN that fits the description.
Minimax GAN: Not correct; minimax refers to the game theory concept, not a GAN type.
Conditional GAN: Correct; Conditional GANs generate data based on specific categories or conditions.
Correct Answer: Conditional GAN

Question 10
What is mode collapse in the context of GANs?

When the model underfits: Not correct; mode collapse is not related to underfitting.
When the model overfits: Not correct; mode collapse is not about overfitting.
When the discriminator becomes too powerful: Not correct; this is not what mode collapse refers to.
When the generator produces limited varieties of outputs: Correct; mode collapse occurs when the generator produces a limited variety of outputs, failing to capture the diversity of the data.
When the model converges too quickly: Not correct; mode collapse is not about quick convergence.
Correct Answer: When the generator produces limited varieties of outputs
