Question 1
Which component of a neural network is responsible for combining inputs and passing them to the next layer?

Neuron (or Node): Correct; the neuron combines inputs using weights and bias, then applies an activation function to pass the result to the next layer.
Activation Function: Not correct; the activation function transforms the neuron's output but does not combine inputs.
Bias: Not correct; the bias shifts the activation function but does not combine inputs.
Weight: Not correct; weights scale the inputs but do not combine them.
Layer: Not correct; the layer is a collection of neurons but not the specific component responsible for combining inputs.
Correct Answer: Neuron (or Node)

Question 2
Which of the following is NOT a common machine learning algorithm?

Decision Trees: Not correct; Decision Trees are a common machine learning algorithm.
Support Vector Machines: Not correct; Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a common machine learning algorithm.
Quantum Entanglement: Correct; Quantum Entanglement is a concept in quantum physics, not a machine learning algorithm.
Neural Networks: Not correct; Neural Networks are a common machine learning algorithm.
K-Means Clustering: Not correct; K-Means Clustering is a common machine learning algorithm.
Correct Answer: Quantum Entanglement

Question 3
In the context of neural networks, what does the term "backpropagation" refer to?

The initial random assignment of weights: Not correct; this refers to weight initialization, not backpropagation.
The method of adjusting weights based on the error: Correct; backpropagation is used to adjust weights by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight.
The process of adding more layers: Not correct; this is related to network architecture, not backpropagation.
The activation of neurons in the hidden layer: Not correct; neuron activation is part of forward propagation, not backpropagation.
The forward flow of data: Not correct; forward propagation refers to the flow of data through the network.
Correct Answer: The method of adjusting weights based on the error

Question 4
Which activation function outputs a value between 0 and 1?

Linear: Not correct; the linear activation function outputs values without bounds.
Leaky ReLU: Not correct; Leaky ReLU outputs values between a small negative value and positive infinity.
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): Not correct; ReLU outputs values between 0 and positive infinity.
Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh): Not correct; tanh outputs values between -1 and 1.
Sigmoid: Correct; the sigmoid function outputs values between 0 and 1.
Correct Answer: Sigmoid

Question 5
What is the primary purpose of a loss function in training neural networks?

To define the network's architecture: Not correct; the architecture is defined separately from the loss function.
To initialize weights: Not correct; weights are initialized using different methods, not by the loss function.
To activate neurons: Not correct; neuron activation is handled by activation functions.
To quantify the difference between predicted and actual values: Correct; the loss function measures how well the model's predictions match the actual data.
To speed up training: Not correct; while the loss function is used in training, its primary purpose is not to speed up training.
Correct Answer: To quantify the difference between predicted and actual values

Question 6
Which of the following is NOT a type of machine learning?

Unsupervised Learning: Not correct; unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning.
Reinforcement Learning: Not correct; reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning.
Supervised Learning: Not correct; supervised learning is a type of machine learning.
Recursive Learning: Correct; recursive learning is not a recognized type of machine learning.
Semi-supervised Learning: Not correct; semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning.
Correct Answer: Recursive Learning

Question 7
What is the primary goal of machine learning?

To increase computational speed: Not correct; increasing computational speed is not the primary goal of machine learning.
To design new algorithms: Not correct; designing new algorithms is a part of research but not the primary goal.
To allow computers to learn from data: Correct; the primary goal of machine learning is to enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions from data.
None of the given options: Not correct; there is a specific goal mentioned.
To program explicit rules for a task: Not correct; machine learning aims to learn from data rather than relying on explicitly programmed rules.
Correct Answer: To allow computers to learn from data

Question 8
Which of the following is a technique to prevent overfitting in neural networks?

Gradient Clipping: Not correct; gradient clipping helps with exploding gradients but not specifically with overfitting.
Using a larger dataset: Not correct; while a larger dataset can help, it's not a direct technique for preventing overfitting.
Increasing the number of layers: Not correct; increasing layers may lead to overfitting if not managed properly.
Dropout: Correct; dropout is a regularization technique specifically designed to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training.
Learning Rate Adjustment: Not correct; adjusting the learning rate helps with convergence but not specifically with overfitting.
Correct Answer: Dropout

Question 9
What is the main difference between regression and classification?

Regression predicts a continuous output, Classification predicts a discrete label: Correct; regression tasks predict continuous values, while classification tasks predict discrete labels.
Classification is unsupervised: Not correct; classification is typically supervised learning.
Regression uses labeled data, Classification doesn't: Not correct; both regression and classification use labeled data.
Both are the same: Not correct; regression and classification have distinct purposes and methods.
Regression is unsupervised: Not correct; regression is a type of supervised learning.
Correct Answer: Regression predicts a continuous output, Classification predicts a discrete label

Question 10
Which application of ML is used to group similar items?

Classification: Not correct; classification is used to assign items to predefined categories.
Recommendation: Not correct; recommendation systems suggest items based on user preferences but do not group similar items.
Ranking: Not correct; ranking orders items but does not group them.
Clustering: Correct; clustering groups similar items together based on features.
Regression: Not correct; regression predicts continuous values, not grouping.
Correct Answer: Clustering
