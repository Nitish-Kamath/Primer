Question 1
How is manual scaling done in EC2 Auto Scaling?

Adjusting Desired capacity: This is the correct way to manually scale in EC2 Auto Scaling. Adjusting the desired capacity lets you increase or decrease the number of instances manually.

Adjusting Max size: This changes the maximum number of instances allowed but doesn't directly scale the number of instances.

Adjusting Min size: This changes the minimum number of instances required but doesn't directly scale the number of instances.

Adjusting the load: This is not an option related to manual scaling in Auto Scaling.

Correct Answer: Adjusting Desired capacity

Question 2
AWS DynamoDB is a serverless NoSQL database (True/False).

True: DynamoDB is indeed a serverless NoSQL database that automatically scales and offers high availability.

False: This would be incorrect as DynamoDB is serverless.

Correct Answer: True

Question 3
Which of the following databases is a key-value pair or document database?

Amazon Neptune: This is a graph database.

Amazon DynamoDB: This is a key-value and document database.

Amazon Redshift: This is a data warehousing service, not a key-value store.

Amazon RDS: This is a relational database service.

Correct Answer: Amazon DynamoDB

Question 4
Which of the following database services is PostgreSQL and MySQL compatible?

Amazon Neptune: This is a graph database, not compatible with PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Amazon Aurora: Aurora is compatible with both MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Amazon Redshift: This is a data warehousing service and is not compatible with these databases.

Amazon RDS: While it can run both PostgreSQL and MySQL, Aurora is a better fit as a native compatibility layer.

Correct Answer: Amazon Aurora

Question 5
Which of the following entities is used for temporary access to resources?

Group: Groups are used for organizing users but do not provide temporary access.

User: Users are for permanent access.

Role: Roles provide temporary access to resources and are used to delegate permissions.

Policy: Policies define permissions but don't directly manage temporary access.

Correct Answer: Role

Question 6
Which of the following services is used for monitoring resources in AWS?

Amazon CloudTrail: This is used for logging API requests.

Amazon CloudWatch: This service is used for monitoring and logging performance data.

Amazon EventBridge: This is an event bus service.

Amazon Cognito: This is used for user authentication.

Correct Answer: Amazon CloudWatch

Question 7
Which CloudWatch component allows you to create and manage custom alarms?

CloudWatch Alarms: These allow you to create alarms that monitor metrics and send notifications.

CloudWatch Logs: This service is for storing and accessing log files.

CloudWatch Metrics: These are used for monitoring data points but not for alarms.

CloudWatch Events: This service delivers a near-real-time stream of system events.

Correct Answer: CloudWatch Alarms

Question 8
Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using Amazon CloudWatch?

Alarm notifications: This is a benefit of CloudWatch.

Automated resource provisioning: This is not a feature of CloudWatch. It's typically associated with Auto Scaling.

Real-time monitoring: This is a benefit of CloudWatch.

Customizable dashboards: This is a benefit of CloudWatch.

Correct Answer: Automated resource provisioning

Question 9
Monitoring the resources helps in ___________

Optimize usage: Monitoring helps identify inefficient use and optimize resource allocation.

Record all API requests: This is done by CloudTrail, not directly by monitoring.

Filtering requests: This is not a typical function of monitoring services.

Identify the unusual activities: Monitoring helps detect anomalies or unusual activities.

Correct Answers: Optimize usage, Identify the unusual activities

Question 10
AutoScaling increases/decreases the capacity of an EC2 instance automatically (True/False).

True: AutoScaling automatically adjusts the number of instances to maintain performance and optimize costs.

False: This would be incorrect as AutoScaling does indeed adjust instance capacity.

Correct Answer: True
