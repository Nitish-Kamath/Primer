Question 1
A pillar focuses on ensuring a system/workload delivers maximum performance for a set of AWS resources utilized.

Operational excellence: This pillar focuses on operations and processes, not directly on performance.

Performance efficiency: This pillar ensures that IT resources are used effectively to meet system requirements, focusing on performance optimization.

Reliability: This pillar ensures that a system can recover from failures and meet operational demands, but it is not focused on performance.

Cost Optimization: This pillar is about managing costs, not directly related to performance.

Correct Answer: Performance efficiency

Question 2
What is the primary goal of the "Security" pillar in the Well-Architected Framework?

Optimal performance: This is not related to security; it concerns performance optimization.

Operates with optimal performance: Again, this is not focused on security.

Maximizing the efficiency of resources: This relates to the Performance Efficiency pillar, not Security.

Protecting data, systems, and assets: The Security pillar aims to protect information, systems, and assets through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

Correct Answer: Protecting data, systems, and assets

Question 3
How does the "Cost Optimization" pillar suggest handling unused or underutilized resources?

Upgrade them to larger instances: This would increase costs and is not recommended for unused resources.

Turn them off when not needed: This is a cost-effective strategy to avoid unnecessary expenses for unused resources.

Keep them running to ensure availability: Keeping unused resources running increases costs without adding value.

Hibernate the instances: While this reduces costs, turning them off is more cost-effective.

Correct Answer: Turn them off when not needed

Question 4
Which pillar of the Well-Architected Framework focuses on the ability to recover from failures and meet customer demands?

Operational excellence: This pillar is about operations and processes, not failure recovery.

Cost Optimization: This pillar focuses on managing costs, not on recovery and availability.

Performance efficiency: This is focused on resource utilization, not on reliability.

Reliability: This pillar is dedicated to ensuring that a system can recover from failures and meet business and customer demands.

Correct Answer: Reliability

Question 5
Which pillar is a combination of processes, continuous improvement, and monitoring systems that delivers business value and continuously improves supporting processes and procedures?

Cost Optimization: This pillar is about managing costs, not continuous improvement processes.

Reliability: This pillar focuses on system availability, not on business process improvement.

Performance efficiency: This relates to optimal use of resources, not process improvement.

Operational excellence: This pillar focuses on processes, improvement, and monitoring to deliver business value continuously.

Correct Answer: Operational excellence

Question 6
___________ focuses on achieving the lowest price for a system/workload. Optimize the cost while considering the account needs without ignoring factors like security, reliability, and performance.

Cost Optimization: This pillar specifically focuses on minimizing costs while maintaining necessary levels of performance, security, and reliability.

Performance efficiency: Focuses on resource utilization rather than cost.

Operational excellence: This is about process improvement, not specifically cost.

Security: This focuses on protecting data and systems, not cost.

Correct Answer: Cost Optimization

Question 7
Which of the following is NOT a pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework?

Cost Optimization: This is one of the pillars.

Operational Excellence: This is one of the pillars.

Persistence: This is not a recognized pillar in the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

Security: This is one of the pillars.

Correct Answer: Persistence

Question 8
The AWS Well-Architected Tool provides a plan on how to architect for the cloud using established best practices.

True: The AWS Well-Architected Tool helps users review their architectures and provides guidance on best practices.

False: Incorrect, as the tool does provide a framework and plan for best practices.

Correct Answer: True

Question 9
____________ is a small, rugged, and secure edge computing and data transfer device.

AWS Snowcone: Snowcone is designed for edge computing and data transfer, being small, portable, and rugged.

Amazon Edge Computing: Not a specific AWS product.

AWS Snowball: Larger and used for data transfer, but not specifically small and rugged like Snowcone.

Amazon CodeWhisperer: An AI coding assistant, not a physical device.

Correct Answer: AWS Snowcone

Question 10
What AWS service is used to convert speech to text?

Amazon Lex: This service is used for building conversational interfaces but not specifically for speech-to-text.

Amazon CodeWhisperer: An AI coding tool, not related to speech.

Amazon Transcribe: This service is designed for converting speech to text.

Amazon Comprehend: This service analyzes text but does not convert speech to text.

Correct Answer: Amazon Transcribe
