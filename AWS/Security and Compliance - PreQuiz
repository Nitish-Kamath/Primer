Question 1
Which of the below option is not a security best practice?

Use roles for applications: This is a best practice as roles provide secure access without sharing credentials.

Grant least privilege: This is a best practice, ensuring that users only have the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.

Use AWS account root user for daily activities: This is not a best practice. The root user has full access to all resources, and using it for daily activities increases security risks.

Remove unnecessary users and credentials: This is a best practice to minimize security vulnerabilities.

Correct Answer: Use AWS account root user for daily activities

Question 2
The person or a workload who uses the AWS resources is known as _________

Privileged user: This refers to users with elevated access but is not the general term for any user.

Normal user: This term is not commonly used in AWS terminology.

Root user: This refers specifically to the AWS account's initial user with full permissions.

AWS user: This is the general term for any entity (person or application) that interacts with AWS resources.

Correct Answer: AWS user

Question 3
The additional layer of security along with the user credentials is __________

Authentication: This is the process of verifying identity but not an additional layer.

Single Sign-On: This allows using one set of credentials across multiple applications but is not an additional layer of security.

Authorization: This process determines what a user can do after authentication, not an additional layer of security.

Multifactor Authentication (MFA): MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification.

Correct Answer: Multifactor Authentication

Question 4
The method of authentication that enables the user to authenticate into multiple applications with one set of credentials is __________

Multifactor authentication: This enhances security with multiple verification steps but does not allow access to multiple applications with a single login.

Authorization: This defines permissions but does not relate to logging in across applications.

Single Sign-On (SSO): SSO allows users to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials.

Authentication: This is the general process of verifying identity but not specifically for accessing multiple applications.

Correct Answer: Single Sign-On

Question 5
Which service is used to control access to the services and resources?

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall): This protects web applications but does not control access to AWS services.

Amazon KMS (Key Management Service): This manages cryptographic keys but does not control access to services.

Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management): IAM controls access to AWS resources by managing users, groups, and permissions.

AWS Shield: This protects against DDoS attacks but does not manage access controls.

Correct Answer: Amazon IAM

Question 6
To organize and manage the AWS resources, _________ is used.

Organizational units: These are used in AWS Organizations for managing accounts, not resources.

Administrative rights: This refers to permissions, not a tool for organizing resources.

Resource management: This is a general concept, not a specific AWS feature.

Resource groups: Resource groups allow you to organize and manage multiple resources in the AWS Management Console.

Correct Answer: Resource groups

Question 7
Security in the cloud means customers are responsible for securing everything they deploy in the cloud.

True: This statement aligns with the shared responsibility model, where customers are responsible for securing the resources they deploy.

False: This would imply AWS handles all security, which is not correct.

Correct Answer: True

Question 8
To simplify the assignment of similar permissions for many users, ______ is used.

Groups: IAM groups allow you to assign permissions to multiple users at once, simplifying management.

Resource management: This is not specifically related to permissions.

Root account: The root account should not be used for managing user permissions.

Organizational units: These are used for managing accounts, not user permissions.

Correct Answer: Groups

Question 9
Which of the following services are managed services?

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): S3 is a fully managed object storage service.

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): RDS is a managed database service that automates many database management tasks.

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): EC2 provides virtual servers, but users must manage the servers themselves.

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store): EBS provides block storage volumes but requires management of the volumes attached to EC2.

Correct Answers: Amazon S3, Amazon RDS

Question 10
AWS is responsible for protecting the Global infrastructure based on the shared responsibility model.

True: AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud infrastructure, including hardware, software, networking, and facilities.

False: This would imply customers are responsible for infrastructure security, which is not the case.

Correct Answer: True
