5: The AWS Well-Architected Framework consists of five pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization.
Correct Answer: 5

Question 6
Which of the following is a best practice for cost optimization in AWS?

Using Expensive Instance Types: Not recommended for cost optimization.

Ignoring Unused Resources: Not a best practice; unused resources should be identified and removed.

Over-provisioning Resources: Leads to unnecessary costs.

Regularly Reviewing and Modifying: Helps in managing and optimizing costs effectively.

Correct Answer: Regularly Reviewing and Modifying

Question 7
Which of the following is not an AWS WAF pillar?

Reliability: Part of the Well-Architected Framework but not specific to AWS WAF.

Availability: Not a specific pillar of AWS WAF.

Security: A key focus of AWS WAF.

Performance Efficiency: AWS WAF helps in security but does not directly relate to performance efficiency.

Correct Answer: Availability

Question 8
AWS IAM belongs to which pillar in the Well-Architected Framework?

Operational Excellence: Focuses on process improvements and operational effectiveness.

Security: IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a key component for managing access and ensuring security.

Reliability: Ensures systems are reliable and can recover from failures.

Performance Efficiency: Deals with optimizing performance but does not cover IAM directly.

Correct Answer: Security

Question 9
Which pillar is responsible for automatic recovery?

Performance Efficiency: Focuses on optimizing resource use and performance.

Security: Ensures protection of resources but does not specifically address recovery.

Reliability: Ensures systems can recover from failures and meet customer demands.

Cost Optimization: Deals with managing costs.

Correct Answer: Reliability

Question 10
What does the Operational Excellence pillar of the Well-Architected Framework focus on?

Enhancing System Reliability: Not the primary focus of Operational Excellence.

Ensuring High Performance: Related to Performance Efficiency.

Streamlining Operations: Focuses on continuous improvement and operational efficiency.
