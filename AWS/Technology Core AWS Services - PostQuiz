Question 1
What are the different types of instances? Choose all that apply.

Storage Optimized: These instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage.

Power Optimized: This is not a recognized instance type in AWS.

General Purpose: These instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources and can be used for a variety of workloads.

Compute Optimized: These instances are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors.

Correct Answers: General purpose, Compute Optimized, Storage Optimized

Question 2
Can you resize an EBS volume on a running EC2 instance?

Without downtime: You can resize an EBS volume on a running EC2 instance without downtime using Elastic Volumes.

Not possible: This is incorrect; resizing is possible.

Certain Volume type: All EBS volume types can be resized.

With downtime: This is not required; resizing can occur without downtime.

Correct Answer: Without downtime

Question 3
Which of the following is a valid EC2 instance type?

xmax: This is not a valid instance type.

xlage: This is not a valid instance type.

t2.micro: This is a valid instance type. It is part of the T2 series, which provides a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline.

micro.t2: This is not a valid instance type format.

Correct Answer: t2.micro

Question 4
What is a virtual server platform that allows users to create and run virtual machines on Amazon’s server farm?

HSM: This stands for Hardware Security Module, which is unrelated to EC2.

VM: This is a general term for virtual machines, not specific to AWS.

EC5: This is not a recognized service or term in AWS.

EC2: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the platform that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

Correct Answer: EC2

Question 5
Custom AMI can be created which includes applications in the image (True/False)

True: You can create a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that includes your applications, libraries, and other settings.

False: This would be incorrect because custom AMIs can indeed include applications.

Correct Answer: True

Question 6
__________ is a master image that provides the information required for the creation of virtual servers known as EC2 instances in the AWS environment.

AIM: This is not related to AMIs.

IAM: This stands for Identity and Access Management, a different AWS service for managing access to AWS resources.

MIA: This is not related to AWS.

AMI: Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is the correct term. It provides the information required to launch an instance.

Correct Answer: AMI

Question 7
What is an AMI?

Amazon Instance: This is incorrect; AMI is not an instance itself.

AmazonMemory Image: This is incorrect and does not define AMI.

Amazon Memory instance: This is incorrect and does not define AMI.

Amazon Machine Image: This is the correct definition for AMI, a template that contains a software configuration.

Correct Answer: Amazon Machine Image

Question 8
EC2 instance type – _________ for compute-intensive workloads.

General purpose: This is not specifically optimized for compute-intensive workloads.

Compute Optimized: These instances are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors.

Storage Optimized: This is for workloads that require high disk throughput.

Memory Optimized: This is for memory-bound applications.

Correct Answer: Compute Optimized

Question 9
An Amazon EBS volume can be attached to multiple instances at a time (True/False).

True: This is incorrect for standard EBS volumes, which can only be attached to one instance at a time. However, with EBS Multi-Attach, it is possible, but only for specific use cases and with some restrictions.

False: This is generally true for standard EBS volumes, which are typically attached to a single EC2 instance.

Correct Answer: False

Question 10
Amazon EC2 Instances utilize Intel® Xeon® processors for providing customers with high performance and value (True/False).

True: Amazon EC2 instances do utilize Intel® Xeon® processors to offer high performance.

False: This would be incorrect, as EC2 instances do use Intel processors.

Correct Answer: True
