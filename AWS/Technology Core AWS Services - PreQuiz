Question 1
When you create a bucket, by default the bucket is private (True/False)

True: By default, Amazon S3 buckets are private, meaning that only the bucket owner can access the contents unless permissions are explicitly set to make the bucket public.

False: This would be incorrect, as buckets are not public by default.

Correct Answer: True

Question 2
In Amazon S3, a single object size can be?

10TB: This is incorrect; Amazon S3 does not support a single object of this size.

5TB: This is the maximum size of a single object in Amazon S3.

1TB: This is incorrect, as S3 supports larger objects.

2TB: This is incorrect, as S3 supports larger objects.

Correct Answer: 5TB

Question 3
What feature is required to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket?

Encryption: This secures data but doesn't allow multiple versions.

Access Point: This is used for managing access but not for versioning.

Versioning: This feature allows multiple versions of the same object to be stored in a bucket, providing the ability to retrieve, delete, or restore different versions.

Replication: This is used for copying data across regions, not for storing multiple versions.

Correct Answer: Versioning

Question 4
Which service is used to create a virtual machine in AWS?

Amazon S3: This service is for object storage, not for creating virtual machines.

Amazon RDS: This is for relational database services.

Elastic Beanstalk: This is for deploying and managing applications, not directly for creating virtual machines.

Amazon EC2: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is used to create and manage virtual machines.

Correct Answer: Amazon EC2

Question 5
Which of the following is a general-purpose Instance Type?

t2.micro: This is a general-purpose instance type suitable for a variety of workloads.

m4.large: This is also a general-purpose instance, but not as lightweight as t2.micro.

p3.2xlarge: This is optimized for GPU-intensive applications.

r5.4xlarge: This is optimized for memory-intensive applications.

Correct Answer: t2.micro

Question 6
What type of storage is S3?

Network storage: This is incorrect; S3 is not classified as network storage.

Block Storage: This is incorrect; AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) is block storage.

Object Storage: Amazon S3 is designed for storing and retrieving any amount of data as objects.

File Storage: This is incorrect; AWS EFS provides file storage.

Correct Answer: Object Storage

Question 7
Which of the following storage classes store files in one Availability Zone?

S3 infrequent access: This is incorrect; it stores data across multiple availability zones.

S3 Glacier: This is incorrect; Glacier is used for long-term archival storage across multiple zones.

S3 One Zone: This storage class stores data in a single availability zone, providing lower-cost storage for data that does not require multi-zone resilience.

S3 standard: This stores data across multiple availability zones.

Correct Answer: S3 One Zone

Question 8
Using S3, you can host_____________

NodeJS application: S3 cannot host server-side applications like NodeJS.

Static Website: S3 is designed to host static websites, serving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Dynamic Website: This requires server-side processing which S3 does not support directly.

PHP Application: Like NodeJS, PHP requires a server to execute the code, which S3 does not provide.

Correct Answer: Static Website

Question 9
S3 Bucket supports versioning? (True/False)

True: S3 supports versioning, allowing you to store multiple versions of the same object in a bucket.

False: This would be incorrect, as S3 does support versioning.

Correct Answer: True

Question 10
Which of the following storage classes is suitable for performance-sensitive data?

S3 infrequent access: This is designed for less frequently accessed data.

S3 One Zone: This offers reduced redundancy, making it less suitable for performance-sensitive data.

S3 Glacier: This is for archival storage and not suitable for performance-sensitive data.

S3 standard: This provides high durability, availability, and performance, making it suitable for performance-sensitive data.

Correct Answer: S3 standard
