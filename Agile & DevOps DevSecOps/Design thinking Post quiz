Correct Answer:
Observer

Explanation:

Observer: This is the correct answer. Observing involves watching how users interact with their environment and products to gain insights into their behaviors, needs, and challenges. It's a key activity in the empathize phase of design thinking.

Ideate: Ideation involves generating ideas and solutions, which occurs after the empathize phase. It focuses on creativity and brainstorming, not direct user observation.

Engage: While engagement can involve interacting with users through interviews or discussions, it is more about active participation rather than passive observation.

Immerse: Immersion involves experiencing the user’s environment firsthand to understand their perspective, but the term "observer" specifically emphasizes watching and analyzing interactions.

Question 2
Question:
Which of the following is mapped by an empath map?

Correct Answers:

Says

Says: This captures the verbal expressions and statements made by users about their experiences and needs.

Thinks: This reflects the users' thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions, which may not always be spoken aloud but can be inferred from their actions and context.

Does: This represents the observable actions and behaviors of users as they interact with their environment and products.

Feels: This captures the emotional responses and feelings of users, providing insight into their motivations and frustrations.

Question 3
Question:
_______ in design thinking is a written, actionable statement that expresses the problem that the design team is trying to address.

Correct Answer:
POV (Point of View)

Explanation:

Bodystorm: Bodystorming is a technique used to physically simulate or act out scenarios to explore and generate ideas. It is not used for defining problem statements.

Ideate: Ideation is the process of generating creative ideas and solutions. It does not involve defining problem statements.

Empathy: Empathy refers to understanding the user's needs and experiences but is not itself a problem statement.

POV (Point of View): This is the correct answer. A POV statement is an actionable problem statement that frames the user’s needs and insights into a concise expression, guiding the design process.

Empathize: The empathize phase involves understanding the user's needs and experiences, which sets the stage for ideation.

Define: The define phase involves synthesizing the information gathered in the empathize phase to create a clear problem statement.

Prototype: Prototyping involves creating tangible models of ideas to explore and test solutions, not researching user needs.
