Question 1
Question:
Which of the following DevSecOps tools allows an All-in-One website security scanner to support developers to detect problems at the most advanced stage?

Correct Answer:
Acunetix

Explanation:

Aqua Security: This is incorrect. Aqua Security is focused on container security, not specifically an all-in-one website security scanner.

Acunetix: This is correct. Acunetix is a web vulnerability scanner that helps detect security issues in web applications.

Codacy: This is incorrect. Codacy is a code quality tool that provides static analysis but is not specifically a web security scanner.

GitLab: This is incorrect. GitLab offers CI/CD capabilities and some security features, but it is not an all-in-one website security scanner.

Question 2
Question:
__________ refers to the process of tracking the identified vulnerabilities, the steps taken to mitigate and/or eliminate those vulnerabilities, and the overall status of the applicationâ€™s security.

Correct Answer:
Monitor

Explanation:

Monitor: This is correct. Monitoring in security involves tracking identified vulnerabilities, mitigation steps, and the status of application security.

Analyze: This is incorrect. Analyzing involves examining the data or vulnerabilities but not necessarily tracking or mitigating them.

Remediate: This is incorrect. Remediation involves fixing vulnerabilities but not the overall tracking and status.

Scan: This is incorrect. Scanning is the process of identifying vulnerabilities, not tracking them or the status of security.

Question 3
Question:
Vulnerability Scanning ensures that code is checked for vulnerabilities at every major stage of the delivery pipeline from the time it is written to, when it is deployed into production.

Correct Answer:
True

Explanation:

True: This is correct. Vulnerability scanning is a continuous process throughout the CI/CD pipeline to ensure security at all stages.

False: This is incorrect. The statement accurately describes the role of vulnerability scanning.

Question 4
Question:
A _________ is an application security solution that can help to find certain vulnerabilities in web applications while they are running in production.

Correct Answer:
Dynamic Analysis Security Testing

Explanation:

Container security: This is incorrect. Container security focuses on securing containerized applications, not specifically web applications.

Software Composition Analysis: This is incorrect. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) examines third-party components for vulnerabilities, not the application itself while running.

Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST): This is correct. DAST tests web applications for vulnerabilities during runtime.

Static Analysis Security Testing: This is incorrect. SAST analyzes source code for vulnerabilities, not runtime applications.

Question 5
Question:
Use a SAST tool to ensure that your code is secure, safe, and reliable.

Correct Answer:
True

Explanation:

True: This is correct. Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) tools analyze source code for security vulnerabilities, ensuring code safety and reliability.

False: This is incorrect. SAST tools are indeed used to secure and verify code quality.
