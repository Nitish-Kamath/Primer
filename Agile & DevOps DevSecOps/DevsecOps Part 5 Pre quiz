Question 1
Question:
Any component that has the potential to adversely impact cyber supply-chain risk is a candidate for Component Analysis.

Correct Answer:
True

Explanation:

True: This is correct. Components that could negatively affect the cyber supply chain are indeed candidates for Component Analysis to assess and mitigate associated risks.

False: This is incorrect. Components with potential risks are precisely the ones that should undergo Component Analysis.

Question 2
Question:
Bill Of Materials (BOM) describe the components included in applications, the version of the components used, and the license types for each.

Correct Answer:
True

Explanation:

True: This is correct. A BOM (Bill of Materials) in software provides a detailed list of the components, their versions, and the licensing information, which is crucial for managing software supply chain risks and compliance.

False: This is incorrect. The BOM does indeed include these details.

Question 3
Question:
Which of the following are the Software Composition Analysis tools?

Correct Answers:

WhiteSource
Dependency Checker
Explanation:

WhiteSource: This is correct. WhiteSource is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that helps in managing open source components and their associated risks.

Dependency Checker: This is correct. Dependency Checker is a tool used for analyzing software dependencies and identifying known vulnerabilities.

Docker: This is incorrect. Docker is a containerization platform and not specifically an SCA tool.

Aqua Security: This is incorrect. Aqua Security focuses on container security rather than SCA.
