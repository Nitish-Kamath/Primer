Question 1
Question:
_________ is an enterprise-grade automated code review solution that uses static code analysis to provide comprehensive vulnerability reporting.

Correct Answer:
Codacy

Explanation:

Codacy: This is correct. Codacy is a code review tool that uses static code analysis to identify and report vulnerabilities and code quality issues.

SonarQube: This is a similar tool but more focused on code quality and technical debt rather than vulnerability reporting.

Acunetix: This is incorrect. Acunetix is a web vulnerability scanner, not a static code analysis tool.

Aqua Security: This is incorrect. Aqua Security focuses on container security, not static code analysis.

Question 2
Question:
___________ is an application security methodology for managing open source components.

Correct Answer:
Software Composition Analysis

Explanation:

Software Composition Analysis (SCA): This is correct. SCA manages and analyzes open source components for security vulnerabilities and licensing issues.

Static Analysis Security Testing: This is incorrect. SAST focuses on analyzing source code for vulnerabilities, not specifically managing open source components.

Container security: This is incorrect. Container security focuses on securing containerized applications rather than managing open source components.

Dynamic Analysis Security Testing: This is incorrect. DAST tests running applications for vulnerabilities rather than managing open source components.

Question 3
Question:
Runtime protection means securing software against threats that can arise when your application starts running.

Correct Answer:
False

Explanation:

False: This is correct. Runtime protection involves monitoring and responding to threats during application runtime, but it is a different concept from just securing software against threats during execution.

True: This is incorrect. While runtime protection does involve securing software during execution, the statement oversimplifies the concept.

Question 4
Question:
__________ provides a summary of possible attack scenarios, outlines the flow of sensitive data, and identifies vulnerabilities and offers potential mitigation options.

Correct Answer:
Threat Modeling

Explanation:

Threat Modeling: This is correct. Threat modeling involves identifying potential attack scenarios, data flows, vulnerabilities, and possible mitigations.

Monitor: This is incorrect. Monitoring involves tracking ongoing activities rather than creating summaries of attack scenarios and vulnerabilities.

Scan: This is incorrect. Scanning involves detecting vulnerabilities but does not provide a summary or outline of attack scenarios.

Remediate: This is incorrect. Remediation focuses on fixing vulnerabilities rather than providing an overview of possible attack scenarios.

Question 5
Question:
_______ is a web-based DevOps program that gives a full CI/CD toolchain out-of-the-box in one particular application.

Correct Answer:
GitLab

Explanation:

GitLab: This is correct. GitLab provides a comprehensive CI/CD toolchain integrated into a single application.

Logz.io: This is incorrect. Logz.io provides log management and monitoring solutions, not a full CI/CD toolchain.

Aqua Security: This is incorrect. Aqua Security focuses on container security rather than providing a CI/CD toolchain.

Contrast Security: This is incorrect. Contrast Security offers application security solutions but not a full CI/CD toolchain.
