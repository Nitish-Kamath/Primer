Question 1
Question:
Which of the following are the Test Automation tools?

Correct Answer:
Selenium

Explanation:

Selenium: This is the correct answer. Selenium is a widely used test automation tool for web applications.

Terraform: This is incorrect. Terraform is an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool used to manage and provision infrastructure.

Vagrant: This is incorrect. Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtualized development environments, not for test automation.

AWS CloudFormation: This is incorrect. AWS CloudFormation is an IaC tool for modeling and setting up Amazon Web Services resources.

Question 2
Question:
Which of the following are the Software Configuration Management tools?

Correct Answers:
Git, CVS

Explanation:

CVS: This is correct. Concurrent Versions System (CVS) is one of the oldest version control systems used for managing source code.

Ansible: This is incorrect. Ansible is an IT automation tool used for configuration management, not for version control.

Docker: This is incorrect. Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, not a configuration management tool.

Git: This is correct. Git is a popular distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.

Question 3
Question:
Infrastructure-as-Code tools are used to create software environments using predefined templates.

Correct Answer:
True

Explanation:

True: This is the correct answer. Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation allow for the definition and provisioning of infrastructure using code and templates.

False: This is incorrect. IaC tools indeed use predefined templates to automate infrastructure setup.

Question 4
Question:
Replacing or modifying older apps with newer microservices architecture can open up the doors to faster development and quicker innovation.

Correct Answer:
True

Explanation:

True: This is the correct answer. Transitioning to a microservices architecture can enhance scalability, improve development speed, and foster innovation by enabling independent development and deployment of services.

False: This is incorrect. Microservices are known for enabling faster development and innovation by decoupling services.

Question 5
Question:
________ is the first phase of the pipeline, where developers put in their code and then again the code goes to the version control system with a proper version tag.

Correct Answer:
Build phase

Explanation:

Build phase: This is the correct answer. In the build phase, the code is compiled, and build artifacts are generated. It also includes version tagging before further stages like testing and deployment.

Deploy phase: This is incorrect. The deploy phase involves deploying the built application to the target environment, not the initial submission and versioning of code.

Test phase: This is incorrect. The test phase involves running automated tests to ensure code quality, not the initial integration and versioning.

Validate phase: This is incorrect. Validation generally occurs later in the process to verify that the software meets required standards and specifications.
