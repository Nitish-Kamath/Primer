Question 1
Question:
DSOMM Level 1 calls for the execution of static analysis tools without any changes to the tools or settings.

Correct Answer:
True

Explanation:

True: This is correct. DSOMM (Dynamic Security Operations Maturity Model) Level 1 typically involves running static analysis tools with default settings, without custom configurations or modifications.

False: This is incorrect. At Level 1, the tools are generally used as-is without adjustments.

Question 2
Question:
Which of the following are considered as the 4-Axes in DSOMM?

Correct Answers:
Static Depth, Intensity

Explanation:

Static Depth: This is correct. In DSOMM, Static Depth refers to the level of detail in static analysis.

Intensity: This is correct. Intensity measures how thoroughly the analysis is conducted.

Collaboration: This is incorrect. Collaboration is not one of the primary axes in DSOMM.

Strategy: This is incorrect. Strategy is not one of the primary axes in DSOMM.

Question 3
Question:
_________ is incorporated in the implementation phase of Secure SDLC.

Correct Answer:
Static Analysis

Explanation:

Static Analysis: This is correct. Static Analysis is used during the implementation phase to review code for security vulnerabilities before deployment.

Security Monitoring/Compliance: This is incorrect. Security Monitoring/Compliance is more relevant to post-deployment phases.

Dynamic Analysis: This is incorrect. Dynamic Analysis is usually part of testing or later phases, not the implementation phase.

OS Hardening, Web/Application Hardening: This is incorrect. These activities are part of deployment or operational phases rather than the implementation phase.

Question 4
Question:
Security issues can be addressed in the SDLC pipeline well before deployment to production.

Correct Answer:
True

Explanation:

True: This is correct. Security issues can and should be addressed throughout the SDLC pipeline, including during development, testing, and staging phases, before deployment to production.

False: This is incorrect. Addressing security issues before production is a best practice.

Question 5
Question:
During the development phase in secure SDLC, teams need to make sure that they use secure coding standards.

Correct Answer:
True

Explanation:

True: This is correct. Using secure coding standards during the development phase helps to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure that the code is secure from the start.

False: This is incorrect. Secure coding standards are essential in the development phase to mitigate security risks.
