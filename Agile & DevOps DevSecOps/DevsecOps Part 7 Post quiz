Question 1
Question:
Ansible leverages SSH to communicate between servers.

Correct Answer:

True
Explanation:

True: Ansible uses SSH (Secure Shell) to communicate with remote servers to execute tasks and manage configurations. This method allows it to securely connect to and manage systems without requiring a client agent on the nodes.
Incorrect Option:

False: This is incorrect because Ansible indeed uses SSH for communication.
Question 2
Question:
Which of the following services natively integrates Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into the management platform?

Correct Answer:

Azure Resource Manager
Explanation:

Azure Resource Manager: Azure Resource Manager provides native support for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing fine-grained access control for resources within Azure.
Incorrect Options:

CF Engine: Does not natively integrate RBAC.
AWS CloudFormation: While it can use AWS IAM roles for access control, it does not provide native RBAC.
Google Cloud Deployment Manager: Does not natively integrate RBAC in the same way as Azure Resource Manager.
Question 3
Question:
Ansible is an example of a pull-based configuration management tool.

Correct Answer:

False
Explanation:

False: Ansible is a push-based configuration management tool. In a push-based system, the control server pushes configuration changes to the nodes. Ansible does not use a pull mechanism where nodes fetch updates from a server.
Incorrect Option:

True: This is incorrect because Ansible uses a push-based approach.
Question 4
Question:
_________ are the components required to operate and manage enterprise IT environments.

Correct Answer:

Infrastructure
Explanation:

Infrastructure: Refers to the fundamental components and resources required to operate and manage IT environments, including hardware, software, and networking resources.
Incorrect Options:

Platform: Refers to a broader environment or ecosystem but not specifically to the components required.
Playbook: Specific to Ansible and used to define tasks and configurations.
Module: Refers to components within a tool but not the complete set of components for managing IT environments.
Question 5
Question:
________ allows you to create “recipes” and “cookbooks” using its Ruby-based DSL.

Correct Answer:

Chef
Explanation:

Chef: Uses a Ruby-based Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to create "recipes" and "cookbooks" for managing configurations and deployments.
Incorrect Options:

Vagrant: Used for managing virtual machine environments, not for creating recipes and cookbooks.
Puppet: Uses its own DSL but does not use the terms "recipes" and "cookbooks."
Terraform: Uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) and does not involve recipes and cookbooks.
