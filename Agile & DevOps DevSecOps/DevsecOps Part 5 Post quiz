Question 1
Question:
Implementing SCA ensures that all of the components in your applications are secure and compliant.

Correct Answer:
True

Explanation:

True: This is correct. Implementing Software Composition Analysis (SCA) helps in identifying vulnerabilities and compliance issues in third-party and open-source components used within applications, improving overall security and compliance.

False: This is incorrect. While SCA significantly enhances security and compliance, it may not ensure absolute security and compliance on its own. It is a crucial part of a broader security and compliance strategy.

Question 2
Question:
__________ is the process of identifying potential areas of risk from the use of third-party and open-source software and hardware components.

Correct Answer:
Component Analysis

Explanation:

Component Analysis: This is correct. Component Analysis involves evaluating third-party and open-source components for potential risks and vulnerabilities, which is crucial for managing software supply chain risks.

Dynamic Analysis: This is incorrect. Dynamic Analysis focuses on evaluating software behavior at runtime rather than assessing third-party components.

Static Analysis: This is incorrect. Static Analysis involves examining code without executing it to find vulnerabilities, but it doesnâ€™t specifically focus on third-party or open-source components.

Configuration Management: This is incorrect. Configuration Management involves managing configurations and settings in software and systems rather than analyzing third-party components.

Question 3
Question:
SAC tools can both spot any security weak points and suggest potential solutions based on the entire code base.

Correct Answer:
True

Explanation:

True: This is correct. Software Assurance and Compliance (SAC) tools can identify security vulnerabilities and sometimes offer recommendations for remediation based on a comprehensive analysis of the code base.

False: This is incorrect. SAC tools are designed to identify vulnerabilities and often suggest fixes or improvements based on their analysis.
