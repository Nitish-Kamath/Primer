Question 1
Question:
________ is the process during which the changes of a system are implemented in a controllable manner by following a predefined model, with some reasonable modifications.

Correct Answer:
a. Change Management

Explanation:

a. Change Management: This is the correct answer. Change management is a systematic approach to dealing with changes, both from the perspective of an organization and on the individual level. It involves planning, implementing, and monitoring changes in a controlled manner to minimize disruption and ensure successful outcomes.

b. Modification Management: This is not a widely recognized term in IT or software development. While it implies managing modifications, it lacks the formal structure and processes associated with change management.

c. Update Management: This refers specifically to managing software updates, such as patches and new versions. It does not encompass the broader activities involved in managing all types of changes to a system.

Question 2
Question:
From the options, select the configuration items that are eligible for configuration management.

Correct Answers:

a. Source code document
b. Design Document
c. Test Report
d. SRS
Explanation for each option:

a. Source code document: This is a correct answer. Source code is a fundamental component of software that needs to be version-controlled and managed to ensure consistency and track changes over time.

b. Design Document: This is a correct answer. Design documents capture the architecture and design decisions for a system, making them critical for configuration management to ensure the software is built according to the intended design.

c. Test Report: This is a correct answer. Test reports document the results of testing activities, providing essential information on the functionality and quality of the software. Managing these reports ensures traceability and accountability for test outcomes.

d. SRS (Software Requirements Specification): This is a correct answer. The SRS document outlines all the requirements the software must meet, serving as a reference throughout the development lifecycle. Managing it is essential to ensure the software meets the agreed-upon requirements.

Question 3
Question:
Tom and Peter work on the same project. Tom does his work and updates the local copy back to the configuration management server. This process is called:

Correct Answer:
b. Check-in

Explanation:

a. Baseline: A baseline is a fixed reference point in the development process, such as a version of a document or software, that has been formally reviewed and agreed upon. It is not the process of submitting code.

b. Check-in: This is the correct answer. Check-in refers to the process of submitting changes from a developerâ€™s local environment to a central repository in a version control system. This operation updates the central repository with the developer's modifications.

c. Management: This is a broad term that does not specifically refer to the process of submitting changes to a version control system.

d. Check-out: This is the process of retrieving a copy of files from a repository to work on locally. It is the opposite of check-in.

Question 4
Question:
Which is the software configuration concept that ensures that change should be done in a controlled and authorized environment?

Correct Answer:
c. Baseline

Explanation:

a. SVN: SVN, or Subversion, is a version control system that helps manage changes to files and directories over time. It provides tools for controlling changes but is not a concept like a baseline.

b. Configuration Database: This is a database used to store configuration information about a system. While it plays a role in managing configurations, it does not directly ensure controlled changes like a baseline does.

c. Baseline: This is the correct answer. A baseline is a snapshot of a system or a document that has been reviewed and approved, serving as a reference point for further development. Changes to the baseline are controlled and authorized, ensuring the system remains stable.

d. Audit: An audit is a review or examination of records to ensure compliance with standards and regulations. While it can identify unauthorized changes, it does not directly control changes.

Question 5
Question:
____________ ensures that when two different people do the work and update parallelly, one should not overwrite the other.

Correct Answer:
a. Synchronization control

Explanation:

a. Synchronization control: This is the correct answer. Synchronization control ensures that changes made by different team members do not conflict with each other. It often involves mechanisms like locking, merging, or conflict resolution in version control systems.

b. Baseline: A baseline is a point of reference in the development process, providing a stable version to compare against. It does not handle real-time conflicts between concurrent updates.

c. Check-in: While check-in is the process of submitting changes to a repository, it does not inherently prevent conflicts. Synchronization control mechanisms are needed to ensure that one person's changes do not overwrite another's.

d. Check-out: This is the process of retrieving files from a repository to work on locally. It does not prevent overwriting changes made by others, especially if two people are working on the same files simultaneously.
