Question 1
Question:
________ is the process during which the changes of a system are implemented in a controllable manner by following a predefined model, with some reasonable modifications.

Correct Answer:
a. Change Management

Explanation:
Change management is a structured approach to transitioning individuals, teams, and organizations from a current state to a desired future state. In the context of software development and IT systems, change management refers to the process of managing changes to a system in a controlled and systematic way. It involves planning, testing, implementing, and monitoring changes to ensure they are made effectively and with minimal disruption.

Question 2
Question:
From the options, select the configuration items that are eligible for configuration management.

Correct Answers:

a. Source code document
b. Design Document
c. Test Report
d. SRS
Explanation:
Configuration management is the practice of handling changes systematically so that a system maintains its integrity over time. Items that are typically subject to configuration management include:

Source Code Document: This is the written code that defines how the software operates.
Design Document: This outlines the architecture and design decisions of the system.
Test Report: This contains results of tests that verify the software's functionality.
SRS (Software Requirements Specification): This document describes the software system to be developed, including functional and non-functional requirements.
These items are critical as they collectively define and document the software system, making them essential for tracking changes and ensuring consistency across the project.

Question 3
Question:
Tom and Peter work on the same project. Tom does his work and updates the local copy back to the configuration management server. This process is called:

Correct Answer:
b. Check-in

Explanation:
Check-in is the process of submitting or committing changes from a developer's local environment to a central repository in a version control system. This operation saves the developer's modifications in the repository and makes them available to other team members. It is a crucial part of collaboration in software development, ensuring that all team members have access to the latest code and changes.

Question 4
Question:
Which is the software configuration concept that ensures that change should be done in a controlled and authorized environment?

Correct Answer:
c. Baseline

Explanation:
A baseline is a reference point in the software development lifecycle marked by a particular version of software or documentation that has been formally reviewed and agreed upon. It serves as a starting point for further development and can only be changed through a formal change control process. Baselines help in tracking the progress of a project and ensure that changes are controlled and authorized, preventing unauthorized modifications.

Question 5
Question:
____________ ensures that when two different people do the work and update parallelly, one should not overwrite the other.

you have to also explain other option that is incorrect in very short
ChatGPT
Sure, let's go through each question again and briefly explain why the other options are incorrect.

Question 1
Question:
________ is the process during which the changes of a system are implemented in a controllable manner by following a predefined model, with some reasonable modifications.

Correct Answer:
a. Change Management

Other Options:

b. Modification Management: This term is not commonly used in the context of software development or IT systems. It doesn't have a specific process associated with it like change management does.

c. Update Management: This refers to the process of managing software updates, often related to installing patches or new versions. It does not encompass the broader scope of managing changes within a system's lifecycle like change management does.

Question 2
Question:
From the options, select the configuration items that are eligible for configuration management.

Correct Answers:

a. Source code document
b. Design Document
c. Test Report
d. SRS
Explanation for each option:

a. Source code document: Correct because source code is a fundamental part of the software that requires version control.

b. Design Document: Correct because design specifications need to be tracked to ensure the software is built as intended.

c. Test Report: Correct because it verifies the software’s functionality and quality.

d. SRS (Software Requirements Specification): Correct because it outlines all the requirements the software must meet.

All these documents are essential to track changes and ensure the integrity and consistency of the software project.

Question 3
Question:
Tom and Peter work on the same project. Tom does his work and updates the local copy back to the configuration management server. This process is called:

Correct Answer:
b. Check-in

Other Options:

a. Baseline: A baseline is a reference point in the development process, not the act of submitting code to a repository.

c. Management: This is a broad term that doesn't specifically refer to the process of submitting changes to a version control system.

d. Check-out: This is the process of downloading a copy of files from the repository to work on locally, opposite to check-in.

Question 4
Question:
Which is the software configuration concept that ensures that change should be done in a controlled and authorized environment?

Correct Answer:
c. Baseline

Other Options:

a. SVN: Short for Subversion, SVN is a version control system, not a concept. It is used to manage changes to files and directories, but it doesn’t ensure controlled change by itself.

b. Configuration Database: This is a database that stores configuration information but doesn't inherently control or authorize changes.

d. Audit: An audit is an examination of records or financial accounts, which can include reviewing change logs, but it doesn't control changes.

Question 5
Question:
____________ ensures that when two different people do the work and update parallelly, one should not overwrite the other.

Correct Answer:
a. Synchronization control

Other Options:

b. Baseline: A baseline is a point of reference in the development process and doesn't handle real-time conflicts between concurrent updates.

c. Check-in: This is the act of submitting changes to a repository, which might include mechanisms to avoid conflicts, but on its own, it doesn't prevent overwrites without synchronization control.

d. Check-out: This is the process of retrieving files from a repository, which doesn't prevent overwriting changes made by others.
