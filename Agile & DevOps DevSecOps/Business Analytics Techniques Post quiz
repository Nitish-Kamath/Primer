Question 1
Question:
The most common form of KPI reporting is ____

Correct Answer:
Dashboarding

Explanation:

CRM (Customer Relationship Management): CRM systems focus on managing a companyâ€™s interactions with current and potential customers. They are not primarily used for KPI reporting, though they can generate reports based on customer data.

ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning): ERP systems integrate various business processes into a single system. While they can produce reports, they are not specifically designed for KPI reporting.

Dashboarding: This is the correct answer. Dashboards provide a visual display of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics, allowing stakeholders to quickly assess performance and make informed decisions. They are the most common method for KPI reporting.

KPIs (Key Performance Indicators): KPIs themselves are metrics used to evaluate performance. They are the content being reported, not a method of reporting.

Question 2
Question:
_____ is the subject matter area on which reports revolve around.

Correct Answer:
Content

Explanation:

Books: Books are physical or digital publications, but they are not the focus of reports in the context of business analytics or reporting.

Digital Files: While reports can be stored as digital files, they are not the subject matter area. Digital files are a format rather than the focus of reports.

Content: This is the correct answer. Content refers to the subject matter or information that reports are based on, such as data insights, analysis results, and business metrics.

Documents: Documents are physical or electronic records, which can include reports, but they are not the subject matter around which reports revolve.

Question 3
Question:
A metric should be time-bound.

Correct Answer:
True

Explanation:

True: This is the correct answer. Metrics should be time-bound to provide a specific time frame for measurement. This allows organizations to track performance over time and assess whether they are meeting their goals within a given period.

False: This is incorrect. Without a time-bound element, metrics lack context and cannot effectively measure progress or performance over a defined period.

Question 4
Question:
____ is an important measure of how well an organization meets or exceeds a customer's expectations.

Correct Answer:
Customer Satisfaction

Explanation:

ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning): ERP systems help manage business processes but do not directly measure customer satisfaction.

KPIs (Key Performance Indicators): KPIs are metrics used to evaluate performance, including customer satisfaction, but they are not the measure itself.

Customer Satisfaction: This is the correct answer. Customer satisfaction measures how well an organization's products or services meet or exceed customer expectations. It is a critical indicator of business success.

CRM (Customer Relationship Management): CRM systems manage customer interactions and can track customer satisfaction metrics, but they are not the measure of satisfaction themselves.

Question 5
Question:
Units per hour is an example of what KPI

Correct Answer:
Quantitative KPI

Explanation:

Qualitative KPI: Qualitative KPIs measure non-numeric outcomes, such as customer satisfaction or employee engagement. "Units per hour" is a numeric measure.

Lagging KPI: Lagging KPIs reflect past performance, such as sales figures for the last quarter. While "units per hour" can be tracked over time, it is primarily a quantitative measure.

Quantitative KPI: This is the correct answer. Quantitative KPIs measure numeric outcomes, such as production rates, sales figures, or revenue. "Units per hour" is a numeric indicator of performance.

Outcome KPI: Outcome KPIs measure the results of business activities, such as profit or customer retention. While "units per hour" can contribute to outcomes, it is primarily a quantitative measure of efficiency.
