1. Choose the correct type of testing for the given scenario:

Scenario: Testing to check if 1,000,000 users can access the website at the same point of time.

Correct Answer: Load Testing

Explanation: Load Testing is designed to determine how well the system handles a large number of concurrent users and how it performs under heavy load conditions.
Incorrect Options:

Usability Testing: Focuses on evaluating how user-friendly and intuitive the interface is, not how the system performs under load.
Performance Testing: Measures the responsiveness and stability of the system under various conditions, but it is broader than just testing for high traffic conditions.
Security Testing: Concerns identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring the system is secure from threats, not handling large numbers of users.
2. Choose the correct type of testing for the given scenario:

Scenario: Testing to check if the GUI components on the screen are working properly.

Correct Answer: Usability Testing

Explanation: Usability Testing evaluates how easy and intuitive the GUI components are for the user, focusing on user interaction with the interface.
Incorrect Options:

Load Testing: Evaluates how well the system handles a large number of users, not the usability of GUI components.
Performance Testing: Assesses system performance metrics such as response time and throughput, rather than GUI usability.
Security Testing: Focuses on the system's ability to resist security threats, not the usability of the interface.
3. Choose the correct type of testing for the given scenario:

Scenario: Testing to check if the report is generated within 5 seconds on the click of a button as agreed in the SRS.

Correct Answer: Performance Testing

Explanation: Performance Testing measures how well the system meets performance requirements, such as generating reports within a specified time frame.
Incorrect Options:

Load Testing: Tests how well the system performs under heavy load conditions, not specific performance criteria like response time.
Usability Testing: Assesses user-friendliness of the application, not performance metrics.
Security Testing: Focuses on security aspects rather than performance response times.
4. Choose the correct type of testing for the given scenario:

Scenario: Testing to check if the card is swiped more than three times with the wrong PIN, resulting in the card being blocked.

Correct Answer: Security Testing

Explanation: Security Testing ensures that the system properly handles security-related scenarios, such as blocking a card after multiple incorrect PIN attempts.
Incorrect Options:

Load Testing: Concerned with system performance under high user load, not security features.
Performance Testing: Measures system responsiveness and stability, not security functionality.
Usability Testing: Evaluates the user experience with the system, not its security mechanisms.
5. What kind of non-functional requirement best suits the scenario:

Scenario: Whenever new offers are published on the online shopping site, an SMS must be sent to all registered customers within 10 minutes of publishing.

Correct Answer: Performance Requirement

Explanation: Performance Requirements involve constraints on how well the system performs, such as timely sending of SMS notifications within a specified period.
Incorrect Options:

Security Requirement: Deals with ensuring the system is secure from unauthorized access, not performance metrics.
Usability Requirement: Focuses on how easy the system is to use, not on performance aspects like response time.
Portability Requirement: Concerns the system's ability to be moved or adapted to different environments, not performance.
6. Whenever a new product arrives, the stock needs to be updated. This requirement is an example of a non-functional requirement. State true or false

Correct Answer: FALSE

Explanation: Updating stock is a functional requirement because it specifies a specific system behavior related to inventory management, not how the system performs in terms of attributes.
Incorrect Option:

TRUE: Suggests that updating stock is a non-functional requirement, which is incorrect. Functional requirements describe specific behaviors or functions of the system.
7. Identify the possible entities from the given options:

Options:
Customer

Sale

customerAge

SalesID

Correct Answers:

Customer: An entity representing a customer in the system.
Sale: An entity representing a sales transaction in the system.
Incorrect Options:

customerAge: This is an attribute of the Customer entity, not an entity itself.
SalesID: This is an identifier or attribute related to the Sale entity, not an entity.
8. Which of the following are available in the SRS Document?

Options:
Design

Functional Requirements

Constraints

Non-Functional Requirements

Correct Answers:

Functional Requirements: Specifies what the system should do.
Constraints: Describes limitations or constraints imposed on the system.
Non-Functional Requirements: Includes performance, usability, and other quality attributes.
Incorrect Options:

Design: Typically detailed in design documents, not the SRS. The SRS focuses on what the system should do rather than how it is designed.
Software Engineering: A broad field encompassing all aspects of software development, not specific to SRS contents.
9. Consider the below scenario: A team has many players, and each player belongs to one team. Identify the cardinality between player and team.

Correct Answer: M:1 (Many-to-One)
Explanation: Each team has multiple players (many-to-one), but each player belongs to only one team.

Incorrect Options:

1:1 (One-to-One): Indicates each player would belong to exactly one team and each team would have exactly one player, which does not fit the scenario.
M
(Many-to-Many): Suggests that players could belong to multiple teams and teams could have multiple players, which is not the case here.
1
(One-to-Many): Implies one team has multiple players but each player could belong to multiple teams, which is incorrect based on the scenario.
