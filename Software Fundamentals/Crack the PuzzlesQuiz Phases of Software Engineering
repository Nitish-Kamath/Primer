2. A lady buys goods worth Rs.200 from a shop. The shopkeeper, selling the goods with zero profit, receives a Rs.1000 note from the lady. He gets change from the next shop, keeps Rs.200 for himself, and returns Rs.800 to the lady. Later, the shopkeeper from the next shop returns with the Rs.1000 note, claiming it is a duplicate, and takes his money back. How much LOSS did the shopkeeper face?

Options:

a. 1000

b. 800

c. 2000

d. 200

Correct Answer:

1000: The shopkeeper's total loss is Rs.1000. This is because he loses the Rs.1000 note (which is a duplicate) and also loses the Rs.800 in change given to the lady.
Incorrect Options:

800: This is the amount of change returned to the lady but does not account for the duplicate Rs.1000 note.
2000: This is incorrect as it overestimates the total loss.
200: This is the value of the goods but does not cover the total financial loss.
Feedback: The total loss is Rs.1000, which includes the duplicate note and the returned change.
