Question 1
Problem Statement: "Automated tools are available in the market for managing change and versioning the software. State if this statement is True or False."

Options:

a. FALSE
b. TRUE
Correct Answer: b. TRUE

Explanation:

TRUE: Automated tools such as version control systems (e.g., Git, SVN) and change management tools (e.g., JIRA) are widely available and used to manage changes and versions of software efficiently.
FALSE: This option is incorrect because it overlooks the fact that automated tools for change and version management do exist and are commonly used in software development.
Question 2
Problem Statement: "Version Management allows parallel concurrent development. State if this statement is True or False."

Options:

a. FALSE
b. TRUE
Correct Answer: b. TRUE

Explanation:

TRUE: Version management systems enable multiple developers to work on different features or fixes concurrently by managing and merging different versions of the codebase.
FALSE: This option is incorrect because it does not acknowledge that version management systems are specifically designed to facilitate parallel development by handling concurrent changes.
Question 3
Problem Statement: "Match the correct option with the respective description."

Process that ensures that changes made are recorded and controlled

Answer 1: Change Management
Who authenticates that the change proposed is valid

Answer 2: Change Control Board
The standard document where the requester fills the change in the change management process

Answer 3: Change Request Form
Process that ensures different versions of the project are managed

Answer 4: Configuration Management
Correct Answer:

Process that ensures that changes made are recorded and controlled → Change Management
Who authenticates that the change proposed is valid → Change Control Board
The standard document where the requester fills the change in the change management process → Change Request Form
Process that ensures different versions of the project are managed → Configuration Management
Explanation:

Change Management: Ensures that changes to the software are recorded, controlled, and managed throughout the lifecycle.
Change Control Board: A group that evaluates and approves or rejects proposed changes to ensure they are valid and necessary.
Change Request Form: A document filled out by the requester to propose changes in the change management process.
Configuration Management: Manages different versions of the software and ensures that all changes are tracked.
Question 4
Problem Statement: "John bought a new laptop with high-end configuration. To protect his laptop and the applications installed, he installed antivirus software. What type of maintenance does this action represent?"

Options:

Adaptive
Preventive
Perfective
Corrective
Correct Answer: Preventive

Explanation:

Preventive: Installing antivirus software to protect against future threats is an example of preventive maintenance, which aims to avoid potential issues before they occur.
Adaptive: This involves modifying the software to work with new environments or platforms, which does not apply to installing antivirus software.
Perfective: This type of maintenance involves enhancing features, which is not relevant to antivirus installation.
Corrective: This addresses fixing existing problems, but installing antivirus software is about preventing future issues rather than fixing current ones.
Question 5
Problem Statement: "The entry door of the server room inside the company can be considered equivalent to which concept in configuration management?"

Options:

Version
SRS artifact
Baseline
Correct Answer: Baseline

Explanation:

Baseline: In configuration management, a baseline is a specification or product that has been formally reviewed and agreed upon, serving as a basis for further development. The entry door represents a fixed and agreed-upon standard for access, similar to how a baseline serves as a reference point in configuration management.
Version: This refers to different iterations of the software or product, not directly related to the concept of a baseline.
SRS artifact: Refers to Software Requirements Specifications documents and does not directly align with the concept of a baseline in configuration management.
Question 6
Problem Statement: "Which of the following describes the change history of an object?"

Options:

a. Check-out
b. Evolution graph
c. Baseline
d. Review Graph
Correct Answer: b. Evolution graph

Explanation:

Evolution Graph: This shows the change history of an object, illustrating how it has evolved over time with various changes and updates.
Check-out: Refers to the process of retrieving an object from a version control system for modification, not describing the change history.
Baseline: Represents a formally reviewed and approved version of the software, not the history of changes.
Review Graph: This is not a standard term in configuration management related to change history.
Question 7
Problem Statement: "From the options provided, identify the features that are part of software configuration management."

Options:

a. Support management
b. Concurrency control
c. Synchronisation control
d. Version management
Correct Answers: b. Concurrency control, c. Synchronisation control, d. Version management

Explanation:

Concurrency Control: Manages simultaneous operations on a software project to prevent conflicts and ensure consistency.
Synchronization Control: Ensures that different versions or components of the software are in sync.
Version Management: Manages and tracks different versions of the software to handle changes effectively.
Support Management: This is not a specific feature of software configuration management.
Question 8
Problem Statement: "_________ is a committee that makes decisions regarding whether or not proposed changes to a software project can be incorporated."

Options:

a. Modify Control Board
b. Change Control Board
c. Decision Committee
d. Updation Control Board
Correct Answer: b. Change Control Board

Explanation:

Change Control Board: A committee responsible for evaluating and making decisions on proposed changes to a software project to determine if they should be incorporated.
Modify Control Board: This is not a standard term related to change management.
Decision Committee: A generic term that does not specifically refer to change management in the context of software projects.
Updation Control Board: This is not a standard term in software configuration management or change control processes.
