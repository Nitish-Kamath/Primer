1. Which of the following options are the steps involved in Requirements Analysis?

Options:

a. Requirements Specification

b. Analysis of the gathered requirements

c. Requirements Gathering

d. Requirements Elicitation

Correct Answers:

Requirements Gathering: This is the initial phase where information is collected from stakeholders about their needs and expectations.
Analysis of the gathered requirements: This step involves evaluating and understanding the gathered requirements to define what is needed in detail.
Incorrect Options:

Requirements Specification: This is typically part of the requirements specification phase, where requirements are documented, rather than analyzed.
Requirements Elicitation: This is the process of collecting requirements from stakeholders and is part of the initial phase rather than the analysis phase.
Feedback: The Requirements Gathering phase is followed by the Analysis of the gathered requirements.

2. From the below options, identify the role of the system analyst.

Options:

a. Writes pseudo code for the given module

b. Creates SRS

c. Creates HLD document

d. Creates high level test cases

Correct Answer:

Creates SRS (Software Requirements Specification): The system analyst is responsible for creating the SRS, which documents the software requirements.
Incorrect Options:

Writes pseudo code for the given module: Typically done by developers or designers, not system analysts.
Creates HLD document: High-Level Design (HLD) is usually created by system designers or architects.
Creates high level test cases: Test cases are typically created by testers or quality assurance teams.
Feedback: The correct role of the system analyst is to create the SRS, which details the requirements of the system.

3. Identify the correct statements from the below options.

Options:

a. Analysis or High level design or Low level design can be performed in any order

b. Analysis is performed followed by High level design and then Low level design

c. Analysis is performed followed by Low level design and then High level design

d. High level design, Low level design followed by Analysis is performed.

Correct Answer:

Analysis is performed followed by High level design and then Low level design: This sequence is the standard approach, starting with analyzing requirements, then designing at a high level, and finally detailing the design.
Incorrect Options:

Analysis or High level design or Low level design can be performed in any order: This is not accurate; there is a logical sequence for these phases.
Analysis is performed followed by Low level design and then High level design: This is incorrect as High level design usually precedes Low level design.
High level design, Low level design followed by Analysis: This sequence is incorrect as Analysis should precede both types of design.
Feedback: The correct sequence is to perform Analysis first, followed by High level design, and then Low level design.

4. Match the correct objectives of each phase involved in Requirements Engineering:

Options:

Requirements Elicitation

Requirements Analysis

Requirements Specification

Answers:

Requirements Elicitation → Gathering requirements from the users, customers, and other stakeholders: This phase involves collecting requirements.
Requirements Analysis → Analyzing the customer and the user/stakeholder to arrive at a definition of software requirements: This involves understanding and defining the requirements in detail.
Requirements Specification → Documents all the requirements properly: This phase involves creating the documentation that clearly specifies the requirements.
Feedback:

Requirements Elicitation involves gathering requirements.
Requirements Analysis involves analyzing and defining requirements.
Requirements Specification involves documenting the requirements.
5. Identify the type of design that helps in transforming the data model created during the requirements analysis phase into the data structures that will be used to implement the software.

Options:

a. Architectural design

b. GUI Design

c. Interface design

d. Data Design

Correct Answer: Data Design

Explanation: Data Design involves creating the data structures and architecture needed for the software, based on the data model from the requirements phase.
Incorrect Options:

Architectural design: Focuses on the overall system architecture and module interactions.
GUI Design: Focuses on the graphical user interface and user experience.
Interface design: Involves defining how software components interact with each other and with users.
Feedback: Data Design transforms the data model into the data structures used in implementation.

6. Match the objectives of the types of design involved:

Options:

Low Level Design

Architecture design

Interface design

Answers:

Low Level Design → Focuses on writing a detailed algorithm: Provides detailed design for each component of the system.
Architecture design → Defines the modules of the system and the functions that each module performs: Outlines the overall structure of the system.
Interface design → Describes how the software communicates with itself, and with the users interacting with the software: Specifies how different system components and users interact.
Feedback:

Low Level Design focuses on detailed algorithms.
Architecture design defines system modules and functions.
Interface design describes communication between system components and users.
