Question 1
Match the following:

I am an odd number; take away an alphabet and I become even. What am I?
Answer: 7 (Removing the letter "s" from "seven" leaves "even".)
I am a number with a couple of friends, quarter a dozen, and you'll find me again. What am I?
Answer: 3 (A couple of friends is 2, and a dozen is 12; quarter of 12 is 3.)
Multiply me by myself and you will get the equivalent of adding me to myself. What am I?
Answer: 2 (2 Ã— 2 = 4 and 2 + 2 = 4.)
Question 2
Find out the logic of series and complete.

The logic is based on the number of letters in the English spelling of the number:

9 = 4 (Nine has 4 letters)
21 = 9 (Twenty-one has 9 letters)
22 = 9 (Twenty-two has 9 letters)
24 = 10 (Twenty-four has 10 letters)
8 = 5 (Eight has 5 letters)
7 = 5 (Seven has 5 letters)
99 = 10 (Ninety-nine has 10 letters)
100 = 7 (One hundred has 7 letters)
16 = 7 (Sixteen has 7 letters)
Correct Answer: 7

Question 3
Take 1 away from me and you get a prime number; add 1 to me and you get twice that prime number.

The prime number is 2:

3 - 1 = 2 (prime number)
3 + 1 = 4 (which is twice 2)
Correct Answer: 3
