Question 1
Problem Statement: "Which of the following options are valid for the relationship between the configuration objects?"

Options:

a. A curved arrow indicates a compositional relation
b. A double-headed straight arrow indicates compositional relation
c. A curved arrow indicates an interrelationship
d. A double-headed straight arrow indicates an interrelationship
Correct Answers: a. A curved arrow indicates a compositional relation, d. A double-headed straight arrow indicates an interrelationship

Explanation:

A curved arrow indicates a compositional relation: Correct. A curved arrow typically denotes a compositional or hierarchical relationship where one object is a part of another.
A double-headed straight arrow indicates compositional relation: Incorrect. A double-headed straight arrow usually indicates an interrelationship or dependency between objects, not a compositional relationship.
A curved arrow indicates an interrelationship: Incorrect. A curved arrow signifies compositional relationships rather than interrelationships.
A double-headed straight arrow indicates an interrelationship: Correct. A double-headed straight arrow shows that there is a mutual or bidirectional relationship between the objects.
Question 2
Problem Statement: "Match the following facts about Version Management"

Options:

When a member of the team wants his code to work in isolation

Answer 1: Create branches
Lock a file

Answer 2: Serialized changes to file
If a file is changed and we want to roll back to the previous version

Answer 3: Automatic backup
Correct Answer:

When a member of the team wants his code to work in isolation → Create branches
Lock a file → Serialized changes to file
If a file is changed and we want to roll back to the previous version → Automatic backup
Explanation:

Create branches: Used to allow individual team members to work on different features or changes in isolation from each other.
Lock a file: Ensures that a file can only be edited by one person at a time, preventing conflicts and ensuring serialized changes.
Automatic backup: Helps to roll back to a previous version of a file if needed, maintaining historical versions.
Question 3
Problem Statement: "Configuration Management, Version Control, Configuration Audit, Change Management. Which of these is responsible for reviewing the items against various specifications for assessing its quality and correctness?"

Options:

Configuration Management
Version Control
Configuration Audit
Change Management
Correct Answer: Configuration Audit

Explanation:

Configuration Audit: Involves reviewing configuration items against their specifications to ensure they meet quality and correctness standards.
Configuration Management: Manages and tracks configuration items but does not specifically focus on auditing their quality.
Version Control: Handles tracking changes and managing different versions of files rather than auditing them.
Change Management: Manages the process of making changes but not specifically the auditing of configuration items.
Question 4
Problem Statement: "Version Control allows users to lock files so they can only be edited by one person at a time and track changes to files. State if this statement is True or False."

Options:

True
False
Correct Answer: True

Explanation:

True: Version control systems do allow for locking files to prevent concurrent edits by multiple users and track changes over time.
False: This option is incorrect because version control systems indeed support file locking and change tracking.
Question 5
Problem Statement: "Choose the missing steps involved in the Change Control Process in the correct order: Identify and submit change request, ______________, Plan the change, Implement and test the change, Verify implementation of change, Close change request."

Options:

a. Review stakeholder feedback
b. Evaluate impacts of change request
c. Collect impacts of change request
d. Analyze the cost of the proposed change
Correct Answer: b. Evaluate impacts of change request

Explanation:

Evaluate impacts of change request: This step involves assessing the potential impacts of the proposed change on the project, ensuring all aspects are considered before planning.
Review stakeholder feedback: This may occur during the evaluation or planning phases but is not a specific step in the basic change control process.
Collect impacts of change request: This is related but less specific than evaluating the impacts.
Analyze the cost of the proposed change: While cost analysis is important, it is part of the evaluation process but not the next step following the request identification.
