Question 1: Copying Array Values
Problem Statement:

In a mathematical quiz context, scores are stored in an array named quizmark. The coordinating person wants to copy these quiz scores into another array named copyquizmark. Which of the following options will correctly perform this operation?

Options:

a. copyquizmark[n] <- quizmark[n]

b. We cannot copy the values from one array to another.

c. FOR index <- 0 to n
copyquizmark[index] <- quizmark[index]
END FOR

d. copyquizmark <- quizmark

Explanation:

Correct Answer: c. FOR index <- 0 to n copyquizmark[index] <- quizmark[index] END FOR

Explanation: This option uses a loop to iterate through each index of the quizmark array and copy its values to the copyquizmark array. This method ensures that all elements are copied from quizmark to copyquizmark.

Incorrect Options:

a. copyquizmark[n] <- quizmark[n]

Explanation: This only copies the element at index n from quizmark to copyquizmark, not the entire array.

b. We cannot copy the values from one array to another.

Explanation: This is incorrect because arrays can be copied using loops or other methods.

d. copyquizmark <- quizmark

Explanation: This assigns copyquizmark to refer to the same array as quizmark, rather than creating a new copy.

Question 2: Array Size
Problem Statement:

Assume the statement number[100] <- 99 is executed. How many elements can be stored inside the array variable number?

Options:

a. The statement gives no clue about the number of elements that can be stored

b. Infinite number of elements

c. 99

d. 100

Explanation:

Correct Answer: a. The statement gives no clue about the number of elements that can be stored

Explanation: The statement only shows that an element with value 99 is assigned to an index, but it does not provide information about the size of the array.

Incorrect Options:

b. Infinite number of elements

Explanation: Arrays have a fixed size, and infinite elements are not possible.

c. 99

Explanation: This is the value assigned to an index, not the size of the array.

d. 100

Explanation: Although this is likely the size of the array, the statement does not confirm it.
