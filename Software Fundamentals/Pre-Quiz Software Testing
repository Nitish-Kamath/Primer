1. The standard document that describes all the requirements of the system is called as â€¦

Options:

a. User Requirement Specification

b. Software Requirement Specification

c. Test Case Document

d. Contract Document

Correct Answer:

Software Requirement Specification (SRS): This document outlines all the requirements for the system, including functional and non-functional requirements.
Incorrect Options:

User Requirement Specification: This is typically a part of the SRS but does not encompass all requirements.
Test Case Document: This document details how to test the system but does not describe the requirements.
Contract Document: This document may include terms and conditions but does not specify detailed requirements.
Feedback: The SRS is the comprehensive document that describes all the requirements of the system.

2. In a remote control car application, the step-by-step execution of the requirement states that when the fuel level goes below the minimum level, the application should indicate the user in red color. However, the output section of the same process mentions that the indicator will glow pink. What is the kind of requirement specified in SRS?

Options:

a. Incomplete

b. Consistent

c. Complete

d. Contradicting

Correct Answer:

Contradicting: The SRS contains conflicting information about the indicator color, which is a contradiction.
Incorrect Options:

Incomplete: The requirement is not incomplete; it is complete but conflicting.
Consistent: The requirement is inconsistent due to conflicting information.
Complete: The requirement is complete in its description but not in its consistency.
Feedback: The requirement is contradictory because it specifies different colors for the indicator in different parts of the SRS.

3. An SRS has the following requirement: "The stock exchange shall show the stock report for the next 24 hours." What is the issue with this requirement?

Options:

Correct Answer:

Ambiguous: The requirement is vague as it does not specify what "show" means, nor does it define the details of the stock report.
Incorrect Options:

Requirement is Correct: The requirement is not clear or specific.
Incorrect: This is too general and does not address the specific issue with the requirement.
Inconsistent: The requirement is not inconsistent but rather ambiguous.
Feedback: The requirement is ambiguous because it lacks specific details on what the stock report should include and how it should be displayed.

Incorrect Options:

System Analysis: This phase focuses on understanding and defining system requirements, which follows requirement gathering.
Customer Analysis: This is not a standard SDLC phase; it might be part of requirement analysis.
Feasibility Analysis: This phase assesses the viability of the project but does not focus on gathering detailed requirements.
Feedback: The Requirement Analysis phase is specifically aimed at gathering and understanding what is expected from the client.
