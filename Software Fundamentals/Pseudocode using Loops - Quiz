Question 1
Select the appropriate code snippet for the given problem statement.

Problem Statement: Check if a given number is a strong number.

Code Snippet:

Correct Answer: WHILE number != 0
The WHILE number != 0 loop continues until the number becomes 0, which is appropriate for extracting digits one by one and computing the factorial of each digit.
Question 2
Choose the pseudocode for the below problem statement.

Problem Statement: Generate an algorithm to find if a number is fancy (palindrome).

Sample Input: 1221

Sample Output: Number is Fancy

Code Snippet:

Correct Answer:
plaintext
Copy code
BEGIN 

DECLARE variables number, reverse, rem, temp 

READ number 

SET reverse = 0, temp = number 

WHILE number !=0 DO 

rem = number%10 

reverse = reverse*10 + rem 

number = number/10 

END WHILE 

IF temp == reverse THEN 

PRINT "Number is Fancy" 

ELSE 

PRINT "Number is Not Fancy" 

END IF 

END 
Explanation:

This pseudocode correctly initializes reverse to 0 and temp to the original number.
It then correctly computes the reverse of the number.
Finally, it compares the original number (temp) with its reverse to determine if it is a palindrome or not.
