a. 600 [+] 400 [‑] 800 [×] 300 [/] 200 = 200
b. 600 [×] 400 [/] 800 [-] 300 [+] 200 = 200
c. 600 [‑] 400 [+] 800 [/] 300 [×] 200 = 200
d. 600 [/] 400 [+] 800 [‑] 300 [×] 200 = 200
Correct Answer: b. 600 [×] 400 [/] 800 [-] 300 [+] 200 = 200

Explanation:

Correct Answer (b): According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction. Evaluating b:

Question: Arrange the words given below in a meaningful sequence.

mathematica
Copy code
Word 2. Paragraph 3. Sentence 4. Letters 5. Phrase
Correct Answer: d. 4,1,5,3,2

Explanation:

Correct Answer (d): The logical order is:
Letters (building blocks of words)
Words (constructed from letters)
Phrase (group of words)
Sentence (group of phrases)
Paragraph (group of sentences)
Incorrect Options:
a: This sequence starts with letters but places the paragraph last, which does not follow the logical development of text.
b: This sequence incorrectly places the paragraph before the sentence and the phrase, which is not logical.

Question 3
Question: Which of the following represents the correct sequence for the given pseudo-code?

sql
Copy code
BEGIN

-------------

-------------

-------------

-------------

END
sql
Copy code
a. DECLARE variables – number1, number2, result
   READ number1 and number2
   result <- number1 * number2
   PRINT result

b. DECLARE variables – number1, number2, result
   result <- number1 * number2
   READ number1 and number2
   PRINT result

c. DECLARE variables – number1, number2, result
   READ number1 and number2
   PRINT result
   result <- number1 * number2

d. READ number1 and number2
   DECLARE variables – number1, number2, result
   result <- number1 * number2
   PRINT result
Correct Answer: a. DECLARE variables – number1, number2, result; READ number1 and number2; result <- number1 * number2; PRINT result

Explanation:

Correct Answer (a): This sequence correctly initializes the variables, reads the input, performs the multiplication, and then prints the result in logical order.

Incorrect Options:

b: The result is computed before reading the input, which is logically incorrect.
c: The result is printed before it is computed, which is incorrect.
d: The declaration step comes after reading inputs, which is not the standard procedure.
Question 4
Question: Identify the meaningful variable names which can be used?

css
Copy code
a. user name
b. $register_number
c. 1num
d. user1
Correct Answers: b. $register_number, d. user1

Explanation:

Correct Answers (b, d): Valid variable names must not start with a number, should not have spaces, and may only start with letters, underscores, or dollar signs.

Incorrect Options:

a: Contains a space, which is not allowed in variable names.
c: Starts with a number, which is not allowed in variable names.
Question 5
Question: An algorithm described in the form of programming language is

sql
Copy code
Pseudo code
(Note: not exactly to any particular programming language, but by using few programming constructs)
Correct Answer: Pseudo code

Explanation:

Question 6
Question: Choose the correct and meaningful pseudo-code to add two numbers.

css
Copy code
a. BEGIN
        READ a, b
        sum=a+b
        PRINT sum
END

b. BEGIN
READ a, b
sum=add(a,b)
DISPLAY sum
END

c. BEGIN
        DECLARE  number1,number2,sum
        READ number1,number2
        sum<----number1+number2
        PRINT sum
END

d. Start the process
READ a,b
ADD a,b and store it in sum
Display sum
Stop
Correct Answer: c. BEGIN DECLARE number1,number2,sum; READ number1,number2; sum <---- number1 + number2; PRINT sum END

Explanation:

Correct Answer (c): This pseudo-code correctly initializes variables, reads inputs, performs addition, and prints the result.

Incorrect Options:

a: Missing declaration of variables and incorrect indentation for proper pseudo-code.
b: Uses a function (add(a,b)) which is not standard in pseudo-code without a proper definition.
d: Uses informal language instead of structured pseudo-code.
Question 7
Question: Which of the following represents the correct sequence for the given algorithm?

    Display the sum value.
    Stop
Correct Answer: d. Start; Get the two numbers; Add the two numbers and store the result in sum; Display the sum value; Stop

Explanation:

Correct Answer (d): This sequence correctly reflects the logical order of operations for adding two numbers.

Incorrect Options:

a: Incorrect sequence with the addition and display steps not in the correct order.
b: Adds the numbers before getting them, which is incorrect.
c: Displays the sum before it is computed, which is incorrect.
