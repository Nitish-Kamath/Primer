Question 1
Decision statements are also called as _______________

Correct Answer: b. Selection logic

Explanation:

Selection logic refers to decision-making statements such as if, else if, and else, which help in selecting different execution paths based on conditions.
Incorrect Options:
a. Program logic: This is a broad term that can encompass various types of logic, not specifically decision-making.
c. Iteration logic: Refers to looping or repetitive processes in a program.
d. Sequence logic: Refers to the order of execution of statements in a program.
Question 2
The given pseudo-code snippet is an example for_______

Correct Answer: c. Simple If logic

Explanation:

Simple If logic checks a single condition and executes a statement if the condition is true.
Incorrect Options:
a. Sequence Logic: Refers to the sequential execution of statements without conditional checks.
b. Else if ladder logic: Involves multiple else if statements to handle multiple conditions.
d. Nested if logic: Involves if statements within other if statements.
Question 3
By default, the flow of a program is________

Correct Answer: b. top to bottom

Explanation:

Programs execute from the top of the code to the bottom by default, unless directed otherwise by control statements.
Incorrect Options:
a. bottom to top: This is not the default flow of program execution.
c. iterative: Refers to looping constructs, not the default execution flow.
d. conditional: Refers to decision-making logic, not the default execution order.
Question 4
Arrange the pseudo-code logic for checking a number divisible by 5 or 11.

Correct Answer:

plaintext
Copy code
BEGIN
DECLARE number
READ number
IF number % 5 == 0
THEN
    PRINT “number divisible by 5”
ELSE IF number % 11 == 0
THEN
    PRINT “number divisible by 11”
ELSE
    PRINT “number not divisible by 5 or 11”
END IF
END
Explanation:

The pseudocode correctly handles checking for divisibility by 5 and 11 and provides appropriate messages for each case.
Incorrect Options: Any arrangement that does not follow this correct logic or structure would be incorrect.
Question 5
______________must be used when a set of statements needs to be executed only if a condition is met.

Correct Answer: c. selection statements

Explanation:

Selection statements (such as if statements) are used to execute a set of statements only if a specified condition is met.
Incorrect Options:
a. Looping statements: Used for repeating a set of statements.
b. Either selection or looping statements: Incorrect because it includes looping, which is not always necessary for conditional execution.
d. Sequential statements: Refers to execution of statements in order, not based on conditions.
Question 6
Consider the pseudo-code snippet. What output do you think the snippet will produce if the sample input for number is 3?

Correct Answer:

plaintext
Copy code
Three
No value
Explanation:

The code first checks if number >= 0 which is true for 3. Then it checks if number == 0, which is false, so it goes to the else block printing "Three". Finally, the PRINT "No Value" statement is always executed as it is outside the if block.
Incorrect Options:
Any option that does not correctly reflect the sequence and placement of PRINT statements would be incorrect.
Question 7
Choose the correct options to complete the pseudo-code and determine whether the number is positive, zero, or negative.

Correct Answer: d. number > 0, number == 0, number < 0

Explanation:

The pseudocode must check if the number is greater than 0, equal to 0, or less than 0 to determine its sign.
Incorrect Options:
a. number < 0, number > 0, number == 0: Incorrect order for checking conditions.
b. number > 0, number > 0, number == 0: Incorrect as the second condition should be number == 0.
c. number > 0, number == 0, number == 0: Incorrect as the last condition should be number < 0.
Question 8
Identify the correct pseudo-code logic for checking a number divisible by 5 or 11.

Correct Answer:

plaintext
Copy code
BEGIN
DECLARE number
READ number
IF number % 5 == 0
THEN
    PRINT “number divisible by 5”
ELSE IF number % 11 == 0
THEN
    PRINT “number divisible by 11”
ELSE
    PRINT “number not divisible by 5 or 11”
END IF
END
Explanation:

This pseudocode correctly checks divisibility by 5 or 11 and provides appropriate messages.
Incorrect Options: Incorrect arrangements or missing keywords.
Question 9
If a doctor gives you 3 pills and tells you to take one pill every half hour, how long would it take before all the pills had been taken?

Correct Answer: d. 1 hour

Explanation:

You take the first pill immediately, the second after 30 minutes, and the third after another 30 minutes. Thus, all three pills are taken within 1 hour.
Incorrect Options: Any duration that does not accurately reflect the sequence and timing would be incorrect.
Question 10
A computer program must either use conditional statements or looping statements or sequential statements to solve a problem. All of them must not appear in the same program. State true/false.

Correct Answer: False

Explanation:

A program can use a combination of conditional, looping, and sequential statements as needed.
Incorrect Option: The statement is false because all types of statements can be used together in a single program.
Question 11
What do you infer from this statement? “Only if Alvin is happy, then he does not go to work.”

Correct Answer: a. If Alvin is not happy, he goes to work.

Explanation:

The statement means that Alvin will only avoid going to work if he is happy. If he is not happy, he will go to work.
Incorrect Options: Any interpretation that does not align with the logical inference from the statement.
Question 12
Which statement logic implements multiple-way selection?

Correct Answer: a. Else if ladder

Explanation:

An else if ladder allows multiple conditions to be checked in sequence, providing multiple potential execution paths.
Incorrect Options:
b. Simple if: Handles only a single condition.
c. If-else: Provides a binary choice between two paths.
d. Sequential: Refers to the order of execution, not multiple-way branching.
Question 13
If there are 6 chocolates and you take away 4, how many do you have?

Correct Answer: b. 4

Explanation:

The chocolates you took away are the ones you have.
Incorrect Options: Any answer that does not account for the chocolates you took would be incorrect.
Question 14
From the option, find the correct pseudo-code to find the greatest of three numbers

Correct Answer:

plaintext
Copy code
BEGIN
DECLARE variables a, b, c
READ a, b, c
IF a > b
    IF a > c
        PRINT “a”
    ELSE
        PRINT “c”
ELSE IF b > c
    PRINT “b”
ELSE
    PRINT “c”
END
Explanation:

This pseudocode uses nested if statements to correctly determine the greatest of three numbers.
Incorrect Options: Any pseudocode that does not properly use nested if statements or has incorrect conditions.
Question 15
Which of the keyword is used to close the IF block, while writing a pseudo-code?

Correct Answer: b. End if

Explanation:

End if is used to denote the end of an if block in pseudocode.
Incorrect Options:
a. Else if: Used to handle additional conditions.
c. End: General term for ending a block but not specific to if.
d. Else: Used for alternative conditions, not to close an if block.
Question 16
When a single if-else logic is used, how many possible choices can be there?

Correct Answer: b. 2

Explanation:

A single if-else statement provides two possible outcomes: the if branch or the else branch.
Incorrect Options:
a. 0: Not applicable as if-else always provides two choices.
c. 3: More than two choices are not possible with a single if-else.
d. 1: Only one choice is not possible with if-else.
