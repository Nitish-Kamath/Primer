Question 1: Dinner Plan Calculation
Problem Statement:

Five friends plan to go out for dinner. They plan to order an equal number of dishes. Each row specifies individual costs. Find the total amount each person needs to pay.

Assume the values for this matrix for 3 dishes are:

Copy code
12 23 18
45 32 60
42 39 23
54 42 60
25 84 30
The output will be:

vbnet
Copy code
Amount to be paid by person 1 is 53
Amount to be paid by person 2 is 137
Amount to be paid by person 3 is 104
Amount to be paid by person 4 is 156
Amount to be paid by person 5 is 139
Code:

vbnet
Copy code
BEGIN 
DECLARE variable arr[5][20], n, sum=0 

FOR j IN 0 to n-1 DO 
    READ arr[i][j] 
END FOR 

END FOR 

FOR i IN 0 TO 4 DO 
    SET sum = 0 
    FOR j IN 0 TO n-1 DO 
        sum = sum + arr[i][j] 
    END FOR 
    PRINT "Amount to be paid by person "+(i+1)+" is "+sum 
END FOR 

END
Explanation:

Correct Answer: b. FOR i IN 0 to 4 DO. This option correctly iterates over the rows of the matrix, which is required to compute the total amount for each person.
Incorrect Options:
a. FOR i IN 0 to 3 DO (Incorrect as it iterates only through the first 4 rows, but we need to cover all 5 rows).
c. FOR i IN 0 to n DO (Incorrect because n is not defined in the given code snippet and might not match the number of rows).
d. FOR i IN 0 to 5 DO (Incorrect as it iterates one extra time, exceeding the number of rows).
Correct Answer: b. FOR i IN 0 to 4 DO

Question 2: Find Maximum Value in Each Row
Problem Statement:

Choose a pseudocode to find the maximum values in each row of a 3x3 matrix.

Assume the values for this matrix are:

Copy code
12 23 18
45 32 60
42 39 23
The output will be:

csharp
Copy code
Max value in row 1 is 23
Max value in row 2 is 60
Max value in row 3 is 42
Code:

vbnet
Copy code
BEGIN 
DECLARE variable arr[3][3] 

FOR i IN 0 to 2 DO 
    FOR j IN 0 to 2 DO 
        READ arr[i][j] 
    END FOR 
END FOR 

FOR i IN 0 TO 2 DO 
    SET max = arr[i][0] 
    FOR j IN 0 TO 2 DO 
        IF arr[i][j] > max THEN 
            max = arr[i][j] 
        END IF 
    END FOR 
    PRINT "Max value in row "+(i+1)+" is "+max 
END FOR 

END
Explanation:

Correct Answer: a. BEGIN DECLARE variable arr[3][3] FOR i IN 0 to 2 DO FOR j IN 0 to 2 DO READ arr[i][j] END FOR END FOR FOR i IN 0 TO 2 DO SET max = arr[i][0] FOR j IN 0 TO 2 DO IF arr[i][j] > max THEN max = arr[i][j] END IF END FOR PRINT "Max value in row "+(i+1)+" is "+max END FOR END. This option correctly initializes the matrix, reads values, finds the maximum in each row, and prints the result.
Incorrect Options:
b. BEGIN DECLARE variable arr[3][3] FOR i IN 0 to 2 DO FOR j IN 0 to 2 DO READ arr[i][j] END FOR END FOR FOR i IN 0 TO 2 DO SET max = arr[i][0] FOR j IN 0 TO 2 DO IF arr[i][j] > max THEN max = arr[i][j] END IF END FOR END FOR PRINT "Max value in row "+(i+1)+" is "+max END (Incorrect because the print statement is outside the loop and will only print the last computed maximum).
c. BEGIN DECLARE variable arr[3][3] FOR i IN 0 to 2 DO FOR j IN 0 to 2 DO END FOR END FOR FOR i IN 0 TO 2 DO READ arr[i][j] SET max = arr[i][0] FOR j IN 0 TO 2 DO IF arr[i][j] > max THEN max = arr[i][j] END IF END FOR PRINT "Max value in row "+(i+1)+" is "+max END FOR END (Incorrect due to the misplaced READ statement and improper loop structure).
d. BEGIN DECLARE variable arr[3][3] FOR i IN 0 to 2 DO FOR j IN 0 to 2 DO READ arr[i][j] END FOR END FOR SET max = arr[i][0] FOR i IN 0 TO 2 DO FOR j IN 0 TO 2 DO IF arr[i][j] > max THEN max = arr[i][j] END IF END FOR PRINT "Max value in row "+(i+1)+" is "+max END FOR END (Incorrect as max is not reset properly for each row and is printed outside the loop).
Correct Answer: a. BEGIN DECLARE variable arr[3][3] FOR i IN 0 to 2 DO FOR j IN 0 to 2 DO READ arr[i][j] END FOR END FOR FOR i IN 0 TO 2 DO SET max = arr[i][0] FOR j IN 0 TO 2 DO IF arr[i][j] > max THEN max = arr[i][j] END IF END FOR PRINT "Max value in row "+(i+1)+" is "+max END FOR END
