1. Match the correct E, T, V, X (Entry, Task, Verify, Exit) criteria for the following scenario:

Review of the artifacts

Answer: Verification

Explanation: Verification is the process of evaluating whether the artifacts meet the requirements and specifications. Reviewing artifacts falls under this category.

Developing HLD and LLD Artifacts

Answer: Task

Explanation: Developing High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) artifacts is an active task involved in the development phase.

Reviewed design document

Answer: Exit

Explanation: The reviewed design document signifies the completion of the review process, thus marking the exit from that particular phase of evaluation.

Input containing the reviewed SRS

Answer: Entry

Explanation: The input containing the reviewed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is used to enter the review phase, thus serving as the entry criterion.

Correct Answer:

Review of the artifacts → Verification
Developing HLD and LLD Artifacts → Task
Reviewed design document → Exit
Input containing the reviewed SRS → Entry
2. Testing performed by the user to ensure that the system meets the agreed-upon quality attributes and specifications is called:

a. Unit testing

Explanation: Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or units of code in isolation, not on the overall system or quality attributes.

b. Integration testing

Explanation: Integration testing evaluates the interaction between integrated units or components but does not focus on user acceptance or system-wide quality attributes.

c. Acceptance testing

Explanation: Acceptance testing is performed by the user to verify that the system meets the agreed-upon quality attributes and specifications, making it the correct choice.

d. System testing

Explanation: System testing tests the complete system to ensure it meets the requirements, but it is not specifically user-driven as acceptance testing is.

Correct Answer: c. Acceptance testing

3. Choose the option that accurately represents the sequential order of phases in the Waterfall model.

a. Requirement Gathering, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Maintenance, Deployment

Explanation: This option incorrectly places Maintenance before Deployment and includes Maintenance, which is not typically part of the Waterfall model's sequential phases.

b. Requirement Gathering, Analysis, Design, Testing, Implementation, Deployment, Maintenance

Explanation: Testing should follow Implementation in the Waterfall model. This option places Testing before Implementation and Maintenance incorrectly.

c. Requirement Gathering, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance

Explanation: This option correctly lists the sequential phases of the Waterfall model: Requirement Gathering, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.

d. Analysis, Requirement Gathering, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance

Explanation: Analysis should come after Requirement Gathering, and this option places them in the wrong order.

Correct Answer: c. Requirement Gathering, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance

4. Which model emphasizes Validation and Verification at each level of stage containment?

a. Spiral model

Explanation: The Spiral model focuses on risk management and iterative development but does not specifically emphasize Validation and Verification at each stage.

b. RAD

Explanation: Rapid Application Development (RAD) emphasizes quick development but does not focus on Validation and Verification at each stage.

c. Throwaway prototyping

Explanation: Throwaway prototyping involves creating and discarding prototypes to understand requirements, but does not focus on validation and verification at each stage.

d. V-Model

Explanation: The V-Model emphasizes Validation and Verification at each stage of development, making it the correct choice.

Correct Answer: d. V-Model

5. Scenario: LIC has manually carried out their process of premium collection for the past 45 years. Now, they have employed the services of another company to automate the process. Which of the following models would you suggest to the outsource company?

a. Waterfall model

Explanation: The Waterfall model is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and is ideal for automating established processes like premium collection.

b. Throwaway prototyping

Explanation: Throwaway prototyping is not ideal for automation of well-established processes as it is more suited for exploring requirements and design.

c. Spiral model

Explanation: The Spiral model is useful for high-risk projects but may be more complex than necessary for automating established processes.

d. Evolutionary prototyping

Explanation: Evolutionary prototyping is suitable for projects with evolving requirements but might be unnecessary for a well-defined automation project.

Correct Answer: a. Waterfall model

6. Consider that you have to develop a flight control system. The system is simulated as such that the original system is working. There are many potential hazards with such a system. What model would you suggest to develop the system?

a. Spiral model

Explanation: The Spiral model is ideal for high-risk projects with potential hazards due to its focus on iterative development and risk management.

b. Waterfall model

Explanation: The Waterfall model may not handle risks as effectively as the Spiral model, making it less suitable for hazardous systems.

c. Evolutionary prototyping

Explanation: Evolutionary prototyping is useful for systems with evolving requirements but may not address risks as effectively as the Spiral model.

d. Throwaway prototyping

Explanation: Throwaway prototyping is less focused on risk management and may not be suitable for a hazardous system like flight control.

Correct Answer: a. Spiral model
